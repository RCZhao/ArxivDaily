            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Direct measurements of the matter power spectrum, $P_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, provide a powerful tool to investigate observed tensions between models of structure growth while also testing the internal consistency of cosmological probes. We analyse cosmic shear data from the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), presenting a deprojected $P_\mathrm{m}(k,z)$, measured in up to three redshift bins. Compared to analyses using previous KiDS releases, we find improved internal consistency in the $z\lesssim0.7$ regime. At large scales, $k\lesssim0.1\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, our power spectrum reconstruction aligns with $\Lambda$CDM predictions with a density fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8=0.81$. Furthermore, at small scales, $k=3$-$20\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the average matter power spectrum is suppressed by $30\%\pm10\%\,{\rm (stat.)}\pm4\%\,{\rm (sys.)}$ with $2.8\sigma$ significance relative to a dark-matter-only model, consistent with expectations of strong baryonic feedback.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Comparison between cosmological studies is usually performed in a statistical manner at the level of the posteriors of cosmological parameters. In this Letter, we show how this approach poorly reflects the differences between cosmological analyses, when applied to cosmological studies using galaxy cluster abundances. We illustrate this by deriving the implications of the best-fit cosmologies from the recent SPT and eROSITA cluster number counts analyses on the Planck thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (t-SZ) probes. We first fix the mass calibration, and find that the Planck cluster sample would theoretically contain 498 clusters with the SPT cosmology, and 1098 clusters with the eROSITA cosmology, instead of the 439 clusters observed. We then fit the Planck number counts to both cosmologies, only varying the hydrostatic mass bias, and find required biases of $0.790 \pm 0.070$ and $0.630 \pm 0.034$ for SPT and eROSITA respectively, instead of the $0.844^{+0.055}_{-0.062}$ derived in Aymerich et al. (2025). Lastly, we compute the expected t-SZ power spectrum obtained from the SPT and eROSITA cosmologies, and compare these to the Planck measurement. While the predicted SPT angular power spectrum is in good agreement with the Planck measurements, the normalisation of the predicted eROSITA angular power spectrum is two times higher at all scales. These two tests highlight the power of comparing predicted cluster abundances and t-SZ power spectra to measured data in a physically interpretable way.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an analysis of Si-III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.06\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high-precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, illuminated by their accretion disks, can reveal valuable information on BH spacetimes via their shadows, which can be used for strong-gravity tests. However, the continuum emission from their highly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with very inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects, like the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of strong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and strongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the way to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed radiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the ISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from accretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes the spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the extended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral phase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator, typically found at $r\sim (10^2-10^4)\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can provide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more information on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we examine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning strong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the fact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the form of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and its spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass, while the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the SMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We seek to determine whether improvements to the lens model and reconstructed source merit the difficulty of handling the extra constraints. We choose the spatially extended $z=0.725$ giant arc in the $z=0.375$ Abell 370 galaxy cluster field for our study. We present 1) a series of pixel-based source reconstructions for cluster mass models exploring the range of uncertainties in our fiducial model, 2) a similar analysis done using a prototype \textit{python} de-lensing code for cluster mass models from each of the Hubble Frontier Fields modeling teams, 3) an optimized model with pixel-based source reconstructions, and 4) and an investigation of how our optimized model affects the cluster mass model locally and globally in the highest-magnification regions. We find that our optimized model 1) is able to correct resolution-limited assumptions in cluster model inputs local to the arc, 2) has significantly smaller arc model residuals than results from the standard Hubble Frontier Fields models, and 3) affects the critical curves and therefore the information derived from highest-magnification zones most significantly in regions local to the arc.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The central regions of disc galaxies host a rich variety of stellar structures: nuclear discs, bars, bulges, and boxy-peanut (BP) bulges. These components are often difficult to disentangle, both photometrically and kinematically, particularly in star-forming galaxies where dust obscuration and complex stellar motions complicate interpretation. In this work, we use data from the GECKOS-MUSE survey to investigate the impact of dust on axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) models, and assess their ability to recover kinematic structure in edge-on disc galaxies. We construct JAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \gtrapprox 85^\circ$) galaxies that span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic complexity. We find that when dust is appropriately masked, the disc regions of each galaxy are fit to $\chi^2_{\text{reduced}}\leq 5$. We analyse two-dimensional residual velocity fields to identify signatures of non-axisymmetric structure. We find that derived dynamical masses are constant within 10% for each galaxy across all dust masking levels. In NGC 3957, a barred boxy galaxy in our sample, we identify velocity residuals that persist even under aggressive dust masking, aligned with bar orbits and supported by photometric bar signatures. We extend this analysis to reveal a bar in IC 1711 and a possible side-on bar in NGC 0522. Our results highlight both the capabilities and limitations of JAM in dusty, edge-on systems and attempt to link residual velocities to known non-axisymmetric kinematic structure.</div>

Using the unfocused stray light mode of the instrument, which provides a wide field-of-view and a stable instrumental background, we perform a sensitive search for photon signatures from dark matter annihilation in the Galactic halo. We model the resulting diffuse X-ray spectrum over the 3-20 keV energy range and search for line-like spectral features that may arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons. No statistically significant excess over the expected astrophysical background is found. We therefore place upper limits on $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ as a function of dark matter mass, assuming a velocity-independent s-wave annihilation and several Galactic dark matter profiles. Across most of the explored mass range our results provide the strongest X-ray constraints to date, reaching the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \lesssim 10^{-33}$ -- $10^{-34}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, and they are complementary to the most recent bounds derived from SRG/ART-XC observations.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\rm F322W2}$ versus $m_{\rm F115W}-m_{\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}^{q>0.6}=0.14\pm0.01$, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to $0.22\,M_{\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of $\alpha=-1.99\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of $\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.</div>

These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024) identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy (a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are fundamental statistical tools for modeling heterogeneous data. Due to the nonconcavity of the likelihood function, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is widely used for parameter estimation of each Gaussian component. Existing analyses of the EM algorithm's convergence to the true parameter focus primarily on either the two-component case or multi-component settings with both known mixing probabilities and known, isotropic covariance matrices. In this work, we establish the minimax optimal rate of convergence of the EM algorithm for multi-component GMMs in full generality. The required separation condition between Gaussian components for EM to converge is the weakest known to date. We develop two distinct analytical approaches, each tailored to a different regime of separation, reflecting two complementary perspectives on the use of EM: parameter estimation and clustering. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that the EM algorithm, when used for community detection, also achieves the minimax optimal rate of misclustering error under milder separation conditions than spectral clustering and Lloyd's algorithm, an interesting result in its own right. Our analysis allows the number of components, the minimal mixing probabilities, the separation between Gaussian components as well as the dimension to grow with the sample size. Simulation studies corroborate the theoretical findings.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.</div>

Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and orbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three proposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias through dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models. The disk migration model provides the best statistical fit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal parameters {\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The formation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value = 0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion scenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\times}10^-17) despite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The detection of interstellar C$_{60}^{+}$ has been debated for 30 years. The contested attribution of a weaker DIB at 9365 {\AA} was re-evaluated here on the basis of a Pearson correlation relative to 9577 {\AA}, which was previously tied to C$_{60}^{+}$ by diverse collaborations. An assessment of 11 sightlines revealed a high correlation amongst 9365$-$9577 {\AA} equivalent widths ($r=0.93 \pm 0.05$), after contamination from an adjacent line was mitigated using both numerical integration and Gaussian fits. In tandem with a recent separate study's high-$r$ evaluation linking 9577$-$9632 {\AA} across a sizable baseline: three interrelated DIBs matching C$_{60}^{+}$ laboratory findings were independently reaffirmed (9365, 9577, 9632 {\AA}).

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution. New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The properties of a remnant black hole can be probed by analyzing the gravitational waves emitted during its ringdown phase. This signal provides a direct test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this study, we apply a time-domain F-statistic framework to the ringdown of GW231028_153006 and find decisive evidence for the presence of the first overtone mode in the signal. The detection of the $\ell|m|n=221$ mode is statistically significant, achieving a Bayes factor of $193$ for an analysis beginning at $10\,M$ after the signal's peak amplitude--a time consistent with the linear perturbation regime. The inclusion of both the fundamental and overtone modes in our model allows for precise constraints on the remnant's properties. We infer a redshifted final mass of $243.0^{+22.7}_{-22.7}\,M_{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.80_{-0.11}^{+0.07}$ (at $90\%$ credibility), derived from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $10.5$. A test of the no-hair theorem, enabled by this two-mode detection, shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory. Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in $\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics, generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The continuum emission from the hot and ionized inner regions of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk that is strongly lensed by the light-ring (i.e., the unstable photon orbit), is always superimposed on that of the locally emitting plasma near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), masking strong-gravity effects and making their study difficult. A cleaner image of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the emission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus be preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate this can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts of the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line emission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR may be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited for strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line illumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun signal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could be evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be acquired. In resolved sources, the combination of information from the image and the spectrum can even facilitate the measurement of the mass of the SMBH.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P < 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100\,pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\% \pm 0.047\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\% \pm 0.032\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample. We note that while our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} < P < 10.0$ days, these occurrence rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} < P < 5.0$ days. This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \zeta \geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \zeta \geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\zeta \lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Accurate X-ray spectroscopic measurements are fundamental for deriving basic physical parameters of the most abundant baryon components in the Universe. The plethora of X-ray observatories currently operational enables a panchromatic view of the high-energy emission of celestial sources. However, uncertainties in the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g. the effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and historically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements. We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload on board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently launched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the best energy resolution at energies above 2 keV. For this purpose, we used the data from a 10-day-long observational campaign targeting the nearby active galactic nucleus NGC 3783, carried out in July 2024. We present a novel model-independent method for assessing the cross-calibration status that is based on a multi-node spline of the spectra with the highest-resolving power (XRISM/Resolve in our campaign). We also estimated the impact of the intrinsic variability of NGC 3783 on the cross-calibration status due to the different time coverages of participating observatories and performed an empirical reassessment of the Resolve throughput at low energies. Based on this analysis, we derived a set of energy-dependent correction factors of the observed responses, enabling a statistically robust analysis of the whole spectral dataset. They will be employed in subsequent papers describing the astrophysical results of the campaign.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We report on the prediscovery observations and constraints of the new interstellar comet 3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS), made by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), for the inbound leg of the comet out to a heliocentric distance of $r_\mathrm{h}=17$ au, or approximately a year before its discovery. We find that 3I/ATLAS has been active inward of a heliocentric distance of at least $r_\mathrm{h}=6.5$ au. The comet followed a brightening rate of $\propto r_\mathrm{h}^{-3.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the only other known interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, and is more consistent with dynamically old long-period comets and short-period comets in the Solar System. By measuring the brightening of the dust coma, we estimate that 3I had a dust production rate of $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim5 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ in early May of 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim6$ au), increasing to $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim30 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ towards mid-July 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim4$ au) assuming 100 micron dust grains, in line with the more recent Hubble Space Telescope measurement made at $r_\mathrm{h}=3.8$ au. Comparison with the prediscovery photometry by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) suggested that 3I started producing constant dust outflow probably around $r_\mathrm{h}\sim9$ au, coinciding with the turn-on distance of CO$_2$ ice. We also conduct a deep search of 3I/ATLAS with multiple nights of data taken in 2024 when the comet was at $r_\mathrm{h}=13$-$17$ au and conclude that the comet was no brighter than 2-5 magnitudes above the coma or bare-nucleus lightcurves. This suggests that the comet did not exhibit strong outbursts during these periods, consistent with 2I/Borisov as well as most long-period Solar System comets.</div>

The primary (secondary) black hole is consistent with merging binary black holes with masses of $75^{+7}_{-7}\,M_\odot$ and $66^{+4}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ ($64^{+8}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ and $59^{+7}_{-9}\,M_\odot$; 90\% credible intervals), respectively.

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recently, a Gaussian Process Regression - neural network (GPRNN) hybrid machine learning method was proposed, which is based on additive-kernel GPR in redundant coordinates constructed by rules [J. Phys. Chem. A 127 (2023) 7823]. The method combined the expressive power of an NN with the robustness of linear regression, in particular, with respect to overfitting when the number of neurons is increased beyond optimal. We introduce opt-GPRNN, in which the redundant coordinates of GPRNN are optimized with a Monte Carlo algorithm and show that when combined with optimization of redundant coordinates, GPRNN attains the lowest test set error with much fewer terms / neurons and retains the advantage of avoiding overfitting when the number of neurons is increased beyond optimal value. The method, opt-GPRNN possesses an expressive power closer to that of a multilayer NN and could obviate the need for deep NNs in some applications. With optimized redundant coordinates, a dimensionality reduction regime is also possible. Examples of application to machine learning an interatomic potential and materials informatics are given.</div>

We focus on two particular contexts of special significance for their observational implications. A set of these orbits is located in the BH photons shell. Therefore the analysis also connects the red-shifting or blue-shifting from replicas (defined through the BH light surfaces) to the BH shadow boundaries. We then concentrate on the equatorial, general relativistic, axially symmetric accretion disks, orbiting around the central attractor. In the analysis we adopted in particular the Polish doughnut models of geometrically thick toroids, to investigate the signals frequency-shifting from the horizons replica as related to the disks surface, inner edge and accretion flows. The findings map the red-shifting and blue-shifting regions of the signals in dependence to the photons impact parameter, view-angle, angular velocity of the emitter and BH spin.

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) is a statistical mechanics model in which the trajectory of a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is rewarded according to the time it spends together with a moving catalyst. More specifically for a system of size $T$, the law of $X$ is tilted by the Gibbs factor $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The moving catalyst $Y=(Y_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is given by the quenched trajectory of a second continuous-time random walk, with the same distribution as $X$ but a different jump rate $\rho\geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition when $\beta$ passes a critical value $\beta_c(\rho)$. We thoroughly investigate the question of disorder relevance to determine whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity affects the features of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we derive lower bounds for the free energy, which results in either a proof of disorder irrelevance or upper bounds on the critical point shift. More precisely, when $\gamma \in(\frac23,1)$, our estimates imply that that $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ and $\rho$ is small, showing disorder irrelevance. When $\gamma\in (0,\frac23]$ our companion paper shows that $\beta_c(\rho)>\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho>0$, showing disorder relevance: we derive here upper bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the lower bounds obtained in our companion paper. For good measure, our analysis also includes the case of the simple random walk of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d\ge 3$) for which no upper bound on the critical point shift was previously known.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This article investigates the question of disorder relevance for the continuous-time Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) and completes the results of our companion paper. The RWPM considers a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$, whose law is modified by a Gibbs weight given by $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $Y=(Y_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a quenched trajectory of a second (independent) random walk and $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The random walk $Y$ has the same distribution as $X$ but a jump rate $\rho \geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition as $\beta$ crosses a critical threshold $\beta_c(\rho)$. The question of disorder relevance then consists in determining whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity $\rho$ changes the properties of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we show that disorder is relevant when $\gamma \in (0,\frac23]$, namely that $\beta_c(\rho)>\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho>0$. We also provide lower bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the upper bounds obtained in our companion paper. Interestingly, in the marginal case $\gamma = \frac23$, disorder is always relevant, independently of the fine properties of the random walk distribution. When $\gamma \in (\frac23,1)$, our companion paper proves that disorder is irrelevant (in particular $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ for $\rho$ small enough). We provide here an upper bound on the free energy in the regime $\gamma\in (\frac 2 3,1)$ that highlights the fact that although disorder is irrelevant, it still has a non-trivial effect on the phase transition, at any $\rho>0$.</div>

Averaging over polarization angles, we find that three-point correlations of the GW signal vanish for tensor and vector modes, while scalar modes generically leave a nonzero imprint. This property makes the GW bispectrum a distinctive and robust diagnostic of scalar polarizations predicted in theories beyond General Relativity. We derive the corresponding response functions for ground-based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometric observables, and we construct an optimal estimator together with simple Fisher forecasts for pulsar-timing sensitivity. As a proof of principle, we show that second-order GWs sourced by primordial magnetogenesis can be characterized by large three-point functions. Our results demonstrate that GW three-point correlations provide a novel observational window on physics beyond General Relativity.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Mid-IR wavelengths are of particular interest to exoplanet science due to the fact they can extend the searchable parameter space to planets that are older and/or colder. However, a significant source of uncertainty at mid-IR wavelengths on ground-based telescopes is the thermal background. This background comes from blackbody radiation in the atmosphere and telescope and is therefore dependent on instrument design and atmospheric conditions. When performing imaging observations, this background manifests as a slowly varying, inhomogeneous signal throughout the image, underlying our data. Photometry at mid-IR can greatly constrain atmospheric models but existing data are usually scarce or have significant error bars due to the difficulty of subtracting the background. Using M-band direct imaging observing sequences on NIRC2, we evaluate the thermal background of the Keck II telescope and attempt to subtract the background in a more comprehensive way. For our primary science target, the forming protoplanet AB Aur b, we present a contrast upper limit of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ in M-band and address the limiting factors in our observation due to the thermal background. We determine that the origin of the systematic components of the thermal background comes from the K-mirror and find that the thermal background is also strongly influenced by emission from the secondary spiders on Keck II.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Describing the large-scale field topology of protoplanetary disks faces significant difficulties and uncertainties. The transport of the large-scale field inside the disk plays an important role in understanding its evolution. We aim to improve our understanding of the dependencies that stellar magnetic fields pose on the large-scale field. We focus on the innermost disk region ($\lesssim$ 0.1 AU), which is crucial for understanding the long-term disk evolution. We present a novel approach combining the evolution of a 1+1D hydrodynamic disk with a large-scale magnetic field, consisting of a stellar dipole truncating the disk and a fossil field. The magnetic flux transport includes advection and diffusion due to laminar, non-ideal MHD effects, such as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. Due to the implicit nature of the numerical method, long-term simulations (in the order of several viscous timescales) are feasible. The large-scale magnetic field topology in stationary models shows a distinct dependence on specific parameters. The innermost disk region is strongly affected by the stellar rotation period and magnetic field strength. The outer disk regions are affected by the X-ray luminosity and the fossil field. Varying the mass flow through the disk affects the large-scale disk field throughout its radial extent. The topology of the large-scale disk field is affected by several stellar and disk parameters. This will affect the efficiency of MHD outflows, which depend on the magnetic field topology. Such outflows might originate from the very inner disk region, the dead zone, or the outer disk. In subsequent studies, we will use these models as a starting point for conducting long-term evolution simulations of the disk and large-scale field on scales of $\sim$ 106 years to investigate the combined evolution of the disk, the magnetic field topology, and the resulting MHD outflows.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that account for label diversity.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos.

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing response given an observed covariate. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in recovering the distribution of missing values. The code for kNNSampler is made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).</div>

We show that, under the finite third moment condition, the same conclusion holds for the ordered component sizes.

The $\mu$-dependence of the coupling, which accounts for gluon effects, is obtained by fitting the lattice QCD results for the pseudo-critical temperature with the fractal model. We then use the new effective coupling in order to compute the dynamical mass, the quark condensate, the thermal susceptibility and, finally, the $T\times\mu$ phase diagram. We consider both extensive and non-extensive statistics, and with a slight variation in the $\mu$-dependent coupling parameters we provide a single result for our model which is able to describe incredibly well the data from STAR, considering the simplicity of the effective model.</div>

            <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</div>

We show that BDRS is equivalent to a Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when applied to the dual of the problem. A special case of the Bregman ADMM is an alternating direction version of the exponential multiplier method. To the best of our knowledge, algorithms proposed in this paper are new to the literature. We also discuss how to use our algorithms to solve the discrete optimal transport (OT) problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithms under certain assumptions, though we point out that one assumption does not apply to the OT problem.</div>

If a particle is the minimal-label particle at its site when it tries to jump left, the jump is executed. If not, `momentum' is transferred to increase the rate of jumping left of the minimal-label particle. Similarly for jumps to the right. The collision rule is `elastic' in the sense that the net rate of flow of mass is independent of the present configuration, in contrast to the exclusion process, for example. We show that the particle masses and jump rates determine explicitly, via a concave majorant of a simple `potential' function associated to the masses and jump rates, a unique partition of the system into maximal stable subsystems. The internal configuration of each stable subsystem remains tight, while the location of each stable subsystem obeys a strong law of large numbers with an explicit speed.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present Flinch, a fully differentiable and high-performance framework for field-level inference on angular maps, developed to improve the flexibility and scalability of current methodologies. Flinch is integrated with differentiable cosmology tools, allowing gradients to propagate from individual map pixels directly to the underlying cosmological parameters. This architecture allows cosmological inference to be carried out directly from the map itself, bypassing the need to specify a likelihood for intermediate summary statistics. Using simulated, masked CMB temperature maps, we validate our pipeline by reconstructing both maps and angular power spectra, and we perform cosmological parameter inference with competitive precision. In comparison with the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, Flinch delivers substantially tighter constraints, with error bars reduced by up to 40%. Among the gradient-based samplers routinely employed in field-level analyses, we further show that MicroCanonical Langevin Monte Carlo provides orders-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency over currently employed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, greatly reducing computational expense.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient, with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data, rather than a training set of simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3667 with \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\sigma_z\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B&gt;5\,\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as TianQin, LISA, and Taiji are expected to conduct joint observations. Such a multi-detector network will provide complementary viewing angles for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), thereby significantly enhancing the capability to reconstruct and localize its spatial distribution. In this paper, we have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB. The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $, which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates prior physical information, often in the form of differential equation constraints, into the process of fitting machine learning models to physical data. Popular PIML approaches, including neural operators, physics-informed neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and neural discrete equilibria, are typically fit to objectives that simultaneously include both data and physical constraints. However, the multi-objective nature of this approach creates ambiguity in the measurement of model quality. This is related to a poor understanding of epistemic uncertainty, and it can lead to surprising failure modes, even when existing statistical metrics suggest strong fits. Working within a Gaussian process regression framework, we introduce the Physics-Informed Log Evidence (PILE) score. Bypassing the ambiguities of test losses, the PILE score is a single, uncertainty-aware metric that provides a selection principle for hyperparameters of a PIML model. We show that PILE minimization yields excellent choices for a wide variety of model parameters, including kernel bandwidth, least squares regularization weights, and even kernel function selection. We also show that, even prior to data acquisition, a special &#39;data-free&#39; case of the PILE score identifies a priori kernel choices that are &#39;well-adapted&#39; to a given PDE. Beyond the kernel setting, we anticipate that the PILE score can be extended to PIML at large, and we outline approaches to do so.</div>

Based on a neural-network parametrization, we perform a Bayesian reweighting of an existing fits of TMDs using lattice data, as well as a joint TMD fit to lattice and experimental data. We consistently find that the inclusion of lattice information shifts the central value of the CSK by approximately 10% and reduces its uncertainty by 40-50%, highlighting the potential of lattice inputs to improve TMD extractions.</div>

Here we calculate the surface density in cold dark matter(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models including baryons, as well as SIDM without baryons, for dwarf galaxies of masses $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ using mock catalogs obtained from simulations as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. We find that the dark matter surface density and column density are nearly constant for CDM and SIDM for this mass range. The halo surface density obtained from the Burkert profile fit is consistent with galactic-scale observations within $1\sigma$. We also computed the empirical scaling relations between the central surface density and maximum velocity using the best-fit dark matter profiles, and found that they agree with observations of Milky Way and M31 dwarfs.</div>

One of the primary obstacles to the statistical detection of the target signal is the presence of residual foreground, which arises from gain calibration errors. Previous studies have shown that gain calibration errors as small as 0.01% can lead to a biased interpretation of the observed signal power spectrum estimation, by nearly an order of magnitude. A recent study further highlights that to retrieve astrophysical parameters accurately, the threshold gain calibration error should be lower than 0.01%. In this work, we develop a post-calibration mitigation strategy that combines foreground subtraction techniques with foreground avoidance to address residual contamination arising from gain calibration errors. We use an end-to-end pipeline 21cmE2E to simulate a realistic sky model and telescope configuration within the 138-146 MHz frequency range. To assess the impact of residual antenna-based gain calibration errors, we perform a detailed power spectrum analysis across several threshold levels. Our analysis shows that the extraction of the target signal over the wavenumber range $0.05 \leq k \leq 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is possible with a threshold gain calibration error of 1%, although with a significant SNR tradeoff on larger scales. Moreover, this work also offers a comparative assessment of foreground removal and avoidance techniques in the context of future SKA1-Low AA* observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent reconstructions of the large-scale cosmological velocity field with kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) tomography have returned an amplitude that is low with respect to the halo model prediction, captured by the kSZ velocity reconstruction bias $b_v &lt;1$. This suggests that common choices for modeling the galaxy-electron cross correlation have systematically overestimated the true power, at least over scales and redshifts used in the velocity reconstruction measurements. In this paper, we study the implications of this overestimation for constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in current and near-future cosmological surveys. For concreteness, we focus on kSZ velocity reconstruction from a Vera Rubin Observatory-like survey in tandem with contemporary cosmic microwave background measurements. Assuming standard choices for the fiducial model of the small-scale galaxy-electron cross correlation, we find that upcoming kSZ tomography measurements can significantly improve constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity via measurement of scale-dependent galaxy bias, in broad concordance with previous studies of the application of kSZ tomography to primordial non-Gaussianity. However, when we instead modify the assumed galaxy-electron cross-spectrum to be consistent with recent measurements of the velocity reconstruction bias, this picture can change appreciably. Specifically, we find that if the inferred suppression of galaxy-electron power persists at higher redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$, kSZ-driven improvement in local primordial non-Gaussianity constraints may be less significant than previously estimated. We explore how these conclusions depend on various modeling and experimental assumptions and discuss implications for the emerging program of kSZ velocity reconstruction.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start&#39;), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the evolution of black hole mass within a cosmological background modeled by a Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) under various dark energy equation of state parametrizations, including Linear, Logarithmic, CPL, JBP, FSLL-II, and Barboza--Alcaniz (BA) models. The logarithmic mass ratio $\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent evolution of $\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic, and CPL models indicating quasi-static accretion, steep slopes in JBP corresponding to rapid late-time variations, and non-monotonic behaviour in FSLL-II and BA highlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive dark energy effects. Peaks, minima, and amplitude offsets in the mass ratio reflect the dynamic interplay between horizon thermodynamics, the evolving pressure of the MCG, and cosmic expansion, illustrating how the black hole mass growth is directly influenced by both the temporal evolution of dark energy and the effective gravitational potential of the surrounding cosmic fluid.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We show that the scattering rate for any dark matter (DM) interaction with electrons in any target is proportional to several measurable material properties, encapsulated by a single master formula. This generalizes the dielectric function formalism--developed for DM interactions that couple to electron density--to any interaction, incorporating both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions simultaneously. This formalism links the full many-body response of a target system to the DM probe in a clear and simple form, providing a reliable event rate prediction from measurable material quantities. We demonstrate the utility of our formalism by placing new limits from existing data on a class of spin-dependent light DM interactions, as their rates--contrary to common lore--are determined entirely by the dielectric function. We further highlight a promising avenue for the detection of sub-MeV DM using the rare earth metal Praseodymium, which exhibits a spin-dependent anisotropic response down to the meV scale. Our results lay the groundwork for a rapid systematic investigation of novel electron scattering targets going beyond the classic spin-independent searches, enhancing the prospects for DM detection.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an extension of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework that enables the automated calculation of leading-order cross sections for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and non-relativistic QED (NRQED) factorisation formalisms. The framework has been validated against a variety of benchmark processes, demonstrating robustness and flexibility for phenomenological studies. A key advantage of this implementation is its seamless integration with existing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO features, allowing computations not only within the Standard Model but also in a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model or Effective Field Theory scenarios via a modified Universal Feynman Output (UFO) interface. Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation. Through numerous examples, we highlight that theoretical studies of quarkonium processes require careful consideration: the impact of subleading contributions is often difficult to predict using simple counting arguments based solely on the hierarchy of couplings and velocity-scaling rules.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe~Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02&lt;z&lt;0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group&#39;s motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive, accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The generation of spiral arms and the mechanisms controlling their properties within a realistic cosmological framework - the complete understanding is still beyond our grasp. Using a statistically significant sample of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31) analogs from the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation, we carry out the first systematic investigation of spiral-arm formation, their observable properties, and the underlying physical drivers. The selected analogs predominantly exhibit two-armed ($m = 2$) spirals in both stars and gas, while the gaseous disks often display stronger, more tightly wound, and multi-armed patterns ($m&gt;2$). Spiral features appear across stellar populations of different ages, confirming their density-wave nature and producing coherent spirals in both metallicity and mean stellar age distributions-consistent with recent Gaia observations of the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals a diverse dynamical scenario for spiral generation: gas content, disk coldness, and shear jointly regulate the growth and morphology of spiral perturbations. We find that the gas content and the dynamical coldness of the disk jointly regulate spiral growth: galaxies with higher gas fractions and colder disks develop more prominent spirals. The measured relation between spiral pitch angle and disk shear shows significant scatter around the analytic prediction, likely due to the combined influence of bars, gas inflows, and feedback. These results demonstrate that spiral density waves can persist in fully cosmological disks, linking internal dynamical processes to galaxy assembly and offering testable predictions for present and future surveys such as JWST and Roman.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We revisit an inflationary scenario in which primordial inhomogeneities arise from a quantum collapse, a stochastic mechanism described in the context of quantum collapse theories in its continuous version and within semiclassical gravity. The predictions of the model show a non-conventional scalar spectrum governed by two new parameters in the collapse rate, whose aim is twofold: on one side, to account for the primordial cosmic structure, and on the other to explain the suppression amplitude associated with long-wavelength modes, thereby eliminating the occurrence of eternal inflation. Furthermore, this model can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$ angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the latest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational constraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\ell$ suppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the Planck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other words, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the cosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Bound-muon decays are a powerful probe of new physics, making precise theoretical predictions for their spectra essential. While QED corrections significantly affect the shape of the spectra, their calculation is extremely challenging below the nuclear scale. By exploring the universality of modern effective-field-theory techniques, we present a framework that systematically computes those corrections across a broad class of bound-muon decays. As a key application, we provide the most accurate predictions to date for the signal and background spectra in muon conversion. We show that radiative corrections modify the leading-order ratio of these spectra by $5\%$ with minimal energy dependence, a result relevant for enhancing the discovery reach of upcoming experiments. Our framework also represents a crucial step toward connecting high-energy physics to low-energy observables, complementing recent progress above the muon mass scale.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske &amp; Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies&#39; properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of accretion.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A terrestrial population of room-temperature millicharged particles can arise if they make up a dark matter subcomponent or if they are light enough to be produced in cosmic ray air showers. In a companion paper, we showed that a simple electrified shell acts as an efficient accumulator for such particles, parametrically enhancing their local density by many orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that Cavendish tests of Coulomb&#39;s Law, performed since the late 18th century, function as both quasistatic accumulators and detectors for this overdensity. Reinterpretations of these past Cavendish tests thus provide some of the strongest bounds on a terrestrial millicharge population. We also propose surrounding a Cavendish test with an additional charged shell, which significantly improves the sensitivity and can even enable detection of the irreducible density of millicharged particles generated from cosmic rays. Using decades-old technology, this can outperform future accelerator searches for sub-GeV masses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We use the full-disk VLT-MUSE mosaic of NGC 253 to identify 2492 HII regions and study their resolved structure. With an average physical resolution of 17 pc, this is one of the largest samples of highly resolved spectrally mapped extragalactic HII regions. Regions of all luminosities exhibit a characteristic emission profile described by a double Gaussian with a marginally resolved or unresolved core with radius &lt;10 pc surrounded by a more extended halo of emission with radius 20-30 pc. Approximately 80% of the emission of a region originates from the halo component. As a result of this compact structure, the luminosity-radius relations for core and effective radii of HII regions depend sensitively on the adopted methodology. Only the isophotal radius yields a robust relationship in NGC 253, but this measurement has an ambiguous physical meaning. We invert the measured emission profiles to infer density profiles and find central densities of n_e = 10-100 cm-3. In the brightest regions, these agree well with densities inferred from the [SII]6716,30 doublet. The central density of HII regions correlates well with the surface brightness within the effective radius. We show that this same scaling relation applies to the recent MUSE+HST catalog for 19 nearby galaxies. We also discuss potential limitations, including completeness, impacts of background subtraction and spatial resolution, and the generality of our results when applied to other galaxies.</div>

Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a novel technique to decompose line-of-sight (LOS) stellar polarization as a function of distance, aimed at reconstructing three dimensional (3D) plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from discrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a simple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the distance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u) to detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical properties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We benchmark the method using mock datasets representative of high-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax uncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey. Tests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and polarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective background-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The dependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization amplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing polarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high Galactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic solutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating its accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both methods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is prior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number of clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly applicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of large-scale stellar polarization surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the high-energy limit of QCD, scattering off nucleons and nuclei can be described in terms of Wilson-line correlators whose energy dependence is perturbative. The energy dependence of the two-point correlator, called the dipole amplitude, is governed by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The initial condition for the BK equation can be fitted to the experimental data, which requires evolving the dipole amplitude for a large set of different parameter values. In this work, we train a transformer model to learn the energy dependence of the dipole amplitude, skipping the time-consuming numerical evaluation of the BK equation. The transformer predicts the learned dipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial condition to the experimental data. Using this setup, we fit the initial condition of the BK equation to the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and consider two different starting points $x_0$ for the evolution. We find better agreement with the experimental data for a smaller $x_0$. This work paves the way for future studies involving global fits of the dipole amplitude at leading order and beyond.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the relationship between disc winds, radio jets, accretion rates and black hole masses of a sample of $\sim$100k quasars at z $\approx$ 2. Combining spectra from the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with radio fluxes from the 2nd data release of the Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), we statistically characterise a radio loud and radio quiet population using a two-component Gaussian Mixture model, and perform population matching in black hole mass and Eddington fraction. We determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a very massive central black hole ($M_{\textrm{BH}} &gt; 10^9 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) or one that is rapidly accreting ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}&gt;0.3$). We also show that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\lambda$1549{\AA} line and the equivalent width of the HeII $\lambda$1640{\AA} line in radio loud and radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars&#39; spectral energy distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux -- which holds for both radio loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line properties -- and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two populations.</div>

Such particles thermalize to terrestrial temperatures through repeated scatters with normal matter in Earth&#39;s environment. We show that a simple electrified shell (e.g., a Van de Graaff generator) functions as an efficient accumulator of such room-temperature millicharged particles, parametrically enhancing their local density by as much as twelve orders of magnitude. This can be used to boost the sensitivity of any detector housed in the shell&#39;s interior, such as ion traps and tests of Coulomb&#39;s law.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z 5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding the diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies is key to reconstructing their evolutionary paths. Traditional models often assume parametric forms such as delayed-tau or exponentially declining models, which may not reflect the actual variety of formation processes. We aim to assess what types of SFHs are consistent with the observed present-day star formation rates (${\text{SFR}}_0$) and time-averaged star formation rates ($\langle \text{SFR} \rangle$) of galaxies in the Local Volume, without assuming any fixed functional form. We construct a non-parametric framework by generating large ensembles of randomized SFHs for each galaxy in the sample. For each SFH, we compute its predicted stellar mass and present-day SFR and retain only those consistent with the observed values within a 20% tolerance. We then infer the statistical distribution of power-law slopes $\eta$ (fitted as ${\text{SFR}}(t) \propto (t-t_{\text{start}})^\eta$) and 50% stellar mass formation times $t_{50}$. Both $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ correlate strongly with the SFR ratio (Spearman $\rho &gt; 0.75$, $p \ll 10^{-16}$), indicating that the shape and timing of star formation are primarily governed by this ratio. The $t_{50}$ distribution shows sharp spikes near 7.74 and 7.86 Gyr, which we attribute to grid discretization combined with filtering, rather than a physical bimodality. Our results confirm that strongly declining SFH templates are disfavored in the Local Volume: most systems are consistent with flat long-term SFHs, with only mild decline or occasional rising. Importantly, this is demonstrated through a fully model-independent, data-driven approach, with per-galaxy uncertainties quantified using the standard error of $\eta$ and $t_{50}$ from the ensemble of accepted SFHs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a novel extended version of the $\Lambda$CDM model that provides analytical solution for Hubble parameter uniting all epochs of cosmic evolution starting from inflation to late-acceleration, with intermediate radiation and matter-dominated epochs. This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\approx10^{13}$\,GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit. Finally, by comparing the evolution of this causal relation and its Navier-Stokes counterpart, we infer that the evolution from inflation to radiation era signifies a fluid transitioning from viscoelastic to pseudoplastic behavior.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge, as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model&#39;s internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state&#39;s strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a suite of 100 cosmologically motivated, controlled N-body simulations designed to advance the understanding of the role of purely gravitational dynamics in the early formation of low-mass galaxy groups (~ 1-5 x 10^13 M_sun). In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of key indicators of dynamical relaxation, with particular emphasis on the secular growth of the diffuse intragroup light (IGL), the four major group galaxies, and the mass distributions of their progenitors. We also assess the diagnostic power of several magnitude gaps between top-ranked galaxies as proxies for dynamical age. As in our previous study, we compare outcomes from three group classes defined by the number of brightest group galaxies (BGGs) present at the end of the simulations. The early assembly of galaxy groups is consistent with a stochastic Poisson process at an approximately constant merger rate. Various dynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity dispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group barycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards virialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems. We further find that first-ranked group members and the IGL, follow distinct growth histories, with the IGL assembled from a more numerous and systematically lower-mass population than the central object. This distinction is particularly pronounced in non-BGG systems, where about one third of the IGL originates from small galaxies, each contributing less than 5% to this component. Among the tested magnitude gaps, the difference between the first- and fourth-ranked galaxies, $\Delta M4-1$, proves a more robust indicator of dynamical age for low-mass groups than the conventional $\Delta M2-1$ gap. The $\Delta M5-1$ and $\Delta M6-1$ gaps also perform well and may be preferable in certain contexts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The fraction of &#34;dark pixels&#34; in the Ly$\alpha$ and other Lyman-series forests at $z\sim 5-6$ provides a powerful constraint on the end of the reionization process. Any spectral region showing transmission must be highly ionized, while dark regions could be ionized or neutral, thus the dark pixel fraction provides a (nearly) model independent upper limit to the volume-filling fraction of the neutral intergalactic medium, modulo choices in binning scale and dark pixel definition. Here we provide updated measurements of the 3.3 comoving Mpc dark pixel fraction at $z=4.85-6.25$ in the Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and Ly$\gamma$ forests of 34 deep $5.8\lesssim z\lesssim 6.6$ quasar spectra from the (enlarged) XQR-30 sample. Using the negative pixel method to measure the dark pixel fraction, we derive fiducial $1\sigma$ upper limits on the volume-average neutral hydrogen fraction of $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle \leq \{0.030 + 0.048, 0.095 + 0.037, 0.191 + 0.056, 0.199 + 0.087\}$ at $\bar{z} = \{5.481, 5.654, 5.831, 6.043\}$ from the optimally sensitive combination of the Ly$\beta$ and Ly$\gamma$ forests. We further demonstrate an alternative method that treats the forest flux as a mixture of dark and transparent regions, where the latter are modeled using a physically-motivated parametric form for the intrinsic opacity distribution. The resulting model-dependent upper limits on $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle$ are similar to those derived from our fiducial model-independent analysis. We confirm that the bulk of reionization must be finished at $z&gt;6$, while leaving room for an extended &#34;soft landing&#34; to the reionization history down to $z\sim 5.4$ suggested by Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The search for dark matter and other photon-portal long-lived particles (LLPs) at electron-positron colliders often relies on the mono-photon signature. At future Higgs factories operating at the $Z$-pole, this approach faces a critical challenge: the irreducible background from $e^+e^- \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ becomes overwhelming. We propose a novel strategy that overcomes this limitation by searching for displaced photons from LLP decays within the barrel of the hadronic calorimeter. This signature exploits the architectural shielding of the detector to create a nearly background-free environment. Our analysis demonstrates exceptional sensitivity to LLPs with decay lengths from $\sim$1 to $10^6$ meters, improving upon conventional searches by up to one order of magnitude for benchmark photon-portal models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Optical variability is a key observational probe for studying the accretion dynamics and central engine physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF&#39;s single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.</div>

The field mass increases the oscillation frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum.

We present FM Agent, a novel and general-purpose multi-agent framework that leverages a synergistic combination of LLM-based reasoning and large-scale evolutionary search to address complex real-world challenges. The core of FM Agent integrates several key innovations: 1) a cold-start initialization phase incorporating expert guidance, 2) a novel evolutionary sampling strategy for iterative optimization, 3) domain-specific evaluators that combine correctness, effectiveness, and LLM-supervised feedback, and 4) a distributed, asynchronous execution infrastructure built on Ray. Demonstrating broad applicability, our system has been evaluated across diverse domains, including operations research, machine learning, GPU kernel optimization, and classical mathematical problems. FM Agent reaches state-of-the-art results autonomously, without human interpretation or tuning -- 1976.3 on ALE-Bench (+5.2\%), 43.56\% on MLE-Bench (+4.0pp), up to 20x speedups on KernelBench, and establishes new state-of-the-art(SOTA) results on several classical mathematical problems. Beyond academic benchmarks, FM Agent shows considerable promise for both large-scale enterprise R\&amp;D workflows and fundamental scientific research, where it can accelerate innovation, automate complex discovery processes, and deliver substantial engineering and scientific advances with broader societal impact.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the minority group and then training classification models with both observed and synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The search for life beyond our Solar system has been a long and difficult endeavour. The majority of current efforts are focused on the potential detection of biosignatures. However, their detection and interpretation are extremely challenging. Technosignatures appear as an attractive alternative, given their expected univocal interpretation. In recent years, the number of publications discussing them have skyrocketted, both in their more rigurous and speculative sides. In this article, we explore the 28.8 years of archival radial velocity data of $\zeta^2$ Ret with the aim of detecting the proposed giant planet Calpamos, suspected source of a signal of technological origin. We performed a global model fitting the radial velocity data along with activity indicators and modelled the stellar magnetic cycle and rotation. The analysis rules out the presence of the proposed planet, as well as of any other planets more massive than 2-20 $\mathrm{M}_\oplus$ $m_{p}$ sin $i$, depending on orbital period. We show that the previously identified long-period RV signal is definitively caused by the magnetic cycle of the star.</div>

We review a selected number of topics where ab-initio QCD-level information about hadrons can be obtained with this computational tool that is hard to come by from other methods. This includes high baryon-density systems such as neutron-star matter (with a sign problem in lattice gauge theory); fragmentation functions; Monte Carlo generation of particles which accounts for quantum correlations in the final state; entropy production in jets; and generally, any application where time evolution in Minkowski space (as opposed to a Euclidean formulation) or where large chemical potentials play an important dynamical role. For other problems, such as the prediction of very highly excited hadron spectroscopy, they will not be a unique, but a complementary tool.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">At the heart of reinforcement learning are actions -- decisions made in response to observations of the environment. Actions are equally fundamental in the modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state transitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems. In this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and reinforcement learning through action-driven processes, and illustrate their application to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from control-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model distribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to maximum entropy reinforcement learning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Jet quenching - the modification of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma - has been extensively studied through weakly coupled scattering amplitudes embedded in parton-shower frameworks. These models, often combined with bulk hydrodynamic evolution, successfully describe a wide range of observables, though they typically rely on assumptions of rapid thermalization and simplified treatments of medium response. Parallel to these developments, jet thermalization has been investigated within the finite-temperature QCD effective kinetic theory, which provides our best microscopic understanding of equilibration in heavy-ion collisions. Early studies of linearized perturbations have highlighted both the promise and the limitations of current approaches, as existing MC implementations face challenges - particularly in the treatment of recoils and particle merging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a new parton-shower algorithm that exactly reproduces the dynamics of the linearized EKT, enabling a first-principles description of jet thermalization with proper inclusion of recoils, holes, quantum statistics, and merging processes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The origin of the Universe&#39;s late-time accelerated expansion remains unknown. The General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory offers a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, attributing cosmic acceleration to entropy growth associated with cosmic and black hole horizons, without invoking a cosmological constant. We test GREA against the latest DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), multiple Type Ia supernova compilations (Union3, Pantheon$\texttt{+}$, DES-SN5YR), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance measurements. While GREA is not nested within $\Lambda$CDM, it achieves a comparable goodness-of-fit, highlighting its potential as a theoretically motivated framework that circumvents some of the fine-tuning issues of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the best-fit model features a transient phantom crossing at $z \lesssim 2$, with $w_a\equiv \mathrm{d} w(a=1)/\mathrm{d}a \simeq-0.3$, in good agreement with observations. However, its present-day value $w_0\equiv w(z=0)$ is tightly constrained to be $w_0\simeq-1$. Upcoming low-redshift (i.e. $z &lt; 1$) cosmological probes, from both background and perturbations, will offer promising avenues for further exploring the viability of the GREA theory.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer&#39;s perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.</div>

By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Rapid and reliable detection and dissemination of source parameter estimation data products from gravitational-wave events, especially sky localization, is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy. Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA&#39;s (LVK&#39;s) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK&#39;s analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI&#39;s ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study presents an analysis of cosmological parameters, focusing on resolving the Hubble tension and constraining neutrino masses within a coupled quintom model. By utilizing datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Pantheon + Analysis, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and CMB Lensing, we explore the interplay between cosmological parameters and observational constraints. The model effectively reduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of $1.37\sigma$ and $1.24\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22 respectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of neutrinos ($\Sigma_{m_{\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\,\text{eV}$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state parameter ($w_{\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe dominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\text{eff}}$ to $-1.02\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in understanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant $\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65 \pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\lambda_{\sigma} = -2.09 \pm 0.082$ and $\lambda_{\phi} = 2.43 \pm 0.12$ are also determined, providing insights into the quintom model&#39;s implications for cosmological dynamics. This study offers compelling evidence for the coupled quintom model&#39;s capability to resolve the Hubble tension and refine constraints on neutrino properties, enhancing our understanding of the universe&#39;s evolution.</div>

In high-energy physics, the question of whether these models can be implemented directly in physics research, or even built from scratch, tailored for particle physics data, has generated an increasing amount of attention.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the first measurement of the cross-correlation between anisotropic birefringence and galaxy number counts, utilizing polarization data from Planck NPIPE and the Quaia quasar catalog. By employing a QML/pseudo-$C_\ell$ combined estimator, we compute the angular power spectrum up to $\ell=191$ from birefringence and clustering maps at $N_{\rm side}=64$. Our analysis indicates that the observed spectrum is well consistent with the null-hypothesis, with a probability to exceed of 37% and an estimated scale-invariant amplitude of $A^{\mathcal{D}_\ell}=(2.22\pm2.09)\times10^{-4}\,\text{deg}$, at the 68% confidence level. Finally, we derive constraints on the axion-parameters within an early dark energy model of birefringence. Our findings reveal an unprecedented upper bound on the axion-photon coupling down to $g_{\phi\gamma}=10^{-15}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for masses around $10^{-32}\,\text{eV}$ and high initial misalignment angles. This result opens a previously unexplored window in parameter space, providing the first constraint in this ultra-light mass regime.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is $2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">SDSS-C4 3028 is a galaxy cluster at $z=0.061$, notable for its unusually high fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the cluster&#39;s X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long quenching time of $&gt;3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an &#34;inside-out&#34; formation and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction ($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the phenomenology of physics beyond the Standard Model in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments using the most general parametrisation of heavy new physics in the framework of Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT), as well as its counterpart below the electroweak scale, Weak Effective Field Theory (WEFT). We compute neutrino production, oscillation, and detection rates in these frameworks, consistently accounting for renormalisation group running as well as SMEFT/WEFT matching. We moreover use appropriately modified neutrino--nucleus cross sections, focusing specifically on the regime of quasi-elastic scattering. Compared to the traditional formalism of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), our approach is theoretically more consistent, and it allows for straightforward joint analyses of data taken at different energy scales and by different experiments including not only neutrino oscillation experiments, but also searches for charged lepton flavour violation, low-energy precision measurements, and the LHC. As a specific example, we carry out a sensitivity study for the DUNE experiment and compute projected limits on the WEFT and SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Together with this paper, we also release a public simulation package called ``GLoBES-EFT&#39;&#39; for consistently simulating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments in the presence of new physics parameterized either in WEFT or in SMEFT. GLoBES-EFT is available from \href{https://github.com/SalvaUrrea2/GLoBES-EFT}{GitHub}.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hawkes process models are used in settings where past events increase the likelihood of future events occurring. Many applications record events as counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation. This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends, periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and weekly Cryptosporidiosis counts, it improves test predictive log-likelihood over standard parametric discrete Hawkes baselines while capturing bursts, delays, and seasonal background variation. The results indicate that flexible discrete-time self-excitation can be achieved without sacrificing scalability or interpretability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in jet classification tasks, yet a key challenge remains: understanding what these models learn and how their features relate to known QCD observables. Improving interpretability is essential for building robust and trustworthy machine learning tools in collider physics. To address this challenge, we investigate graph neural networks for quark-gluon discrimination, systematically incorporating physics-motivated inductive biases. In particular, we design message-passing architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2) and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning in collider physics.</div>

Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging. This iteration, Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn (GZCD), saw tens of thousands of volunteers and the deep learning foundation model Zoobot collectively classify objects in ultra-deep multiband Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging down to a depth of $m_{HSC-i} = 21.5$. Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the newly operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</div>

Integrating out metastable or slowly equilibrating fields generates temporal kernels in the EFT, yielding a history-dependent effective potential for the $U(1)_X$ scalar. These non-Markovian terms qualitatively alter first-order phase transition dynamics by modifying bubble nucleation, latent heat release, and wall propagation. The resulting stochastic gravitational-wave spectrum exhibits distinctive features such as broadened peaks, asymmetric slopes, and possible secondary ``echoes&#39;&#39; that are absent in conventional Markovian treatments. When the memory-generating sector also participates in dark matter production, the same kernel parameters correlate gravitational-wave signatures with the relic abundance. This work establishes the EFT formalism for non-equilibrium symmetry breaking and highlights testable predictions for upcoming GW observatories and DM searches.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the expected accuracy of redshifts that can be obtained using low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS). By leveraging 40 densely sampled filters with widths of full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 25 nm, we create 7DS mock catalogs and estimate the redshift accuracy for three 7DS main surveys: Wide-field Time-Domain Survey (WTS), Intensive Monitoring Survey (IMS), and Reference Image Survey (RIS). Using photometric redshifts calculated from EAZY, we find that the five-year WTS provides reliable photometric redshifts with an normalized median absolute deviation (${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$) ranging from 0.003 to 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction ({\eta}) from 0.8% to 8.1% at $19 \leq m_{625}$ &lt; 22$. The spectral resolution R ~ 50 of the medium-band dataset effectively captures the 4000 {\AA} break and various emission lines. We also explore the synergy with data obtained from Pan-STARRS1, VIKING, and SPHEREx surveys. Combining the SPHEREx all-sky data with WTS significantly improves the accuracy of photometric redshift estimates, achieving {\eta} = 0.4% and ${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$ = 0.004 for fainter sources at higher redshifts. The additional near-IR information provided by SPHEREx and VIKING plays an essential role in resolving degeneracies between low and high redshifts. We also observe color excesses by subtracting adjacent broad-band data, which improves the confinement of photometric redshifts and aids in the detection of strong emission line galaxies.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">It is anticipated that the faint 21 cm signal emitted by neutral hydrogen within cosmic filaments can be detected. However, because of the signal&#39;s weakness, stacking techniques are necessary. We assessed two stacking methods--pair stacking and filament stacking--using the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Pair stacking leverages the fact that cosmic filaments serve as the connectors between cosmic web nodes, while filament stacking directly aggregates cosmic filaments identified by galaxy distributions. Our analysis indicates that, although pair stacking is convenient, it faces contamination from massive structures, the signal from filament gets very weak after the contamination is removed. Conversely, HI detection via filament stacking appears more viable. The column density exceeds $10^{17} \,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ even when all halos are masked, and it is nearly 10 times higher than what is achieved with pair stacking. The effectiveness of filament stacking could further increase with a high number density galaxy catalog and better spatial resolution in radio observation intensity mapping. With the advent of new optical and radio data, the future detection of HI filaments looks promising.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">High velocity clouds supply the Milky Way with gas that sustains star formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact contribution to the Galaxy&#39;s gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I equivalent width excess ($&gt;$0.1 Angstroms, $&gt;$3sigma) relative to the control. Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low dust-to-gas ratio. Given that the excess Na I begins at distances $&lt;2$ kpc uniquely in the direction of the Cloud, and previous estimates of the SC place it at 12.4 $\pm$ 1.3 kpc, further investigation of its distance is warranted.</div>

In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU, which enables the automation of initializing and starting the AMSS-NCKU simulations and the automatically generating visualizations of the output results. Numerical relativity simulations using this Python interface have been presented through two representative examples (binary back hole and triple black hole merger processes), and well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems have been acquired. The Python operational interface significantly lowers the operational complexity of the simulation workflow of AMSS-NCKU simulations, reducing the technical barriers for freshman users.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse. For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes -- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Most uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches provide a single scalar value as a measure of model reliability. However, different uncertainty measures could provide complementary information on the prediction confidence. Even measures targeting the same type of uncertainty (e.g., ensemble-based and density-based measures of epistemic uncertainty) may capture different failure modes. We take a multidimensional view on UQ by stacking complementary UQ measures into a vector. Such vectors are assigned with Monge-Kantorovich ranks produced by an optimal-transport-based ordering method. The prediction is then deemed more uncertain than the other if it has a higher rank. The resulting VecUQ-OT algorithm uses entropy-regularized optimal transport. The transport map is learned on vectors of scores from in-distribution data and, by design, applies to unseen inputs, including out-of-distribution cases, without retraining. Our framework supports flexible non-additive uncertainty fusion (including aleatoric and epistemic components). It yields a robust ordering for downstream tasks such as selective prediction, misclassification detection, out-of-distribution detection, and selective generation. Across synthetic, image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows high efficiency even when individual measures fail. The code for the method is available at: https://github.com/stat-ml/multidimensional_uncertainty.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The nucleation of bubbles in first-order phase transitions is traditionally characterised by the critical bubble: defined as the saddle-point solution of the Euclidean action that separates collapsing from expanding field configurations. While this picture is exact in the noiseless, zero-temperature limit, thermal fluctuations introduces stochasticity which can influence the behaviour of the field configuration. In this work, we develop a purely statistical criterion for identifying the critical bubble by leveraging the concept of the ``committor&#39;&#39; probability: the likelihood that a given local field configuration evolves to the true vacuum before returning to the false vacuum. Using ensembles of lattice simulations with controlled thermal noise, we extract the committor probability during the evolution of a bubble from sub- to super-criticality. We find this approach to be robust, accounts for finite-temperature effects, and allows independent verification of bounce-based predictions. To demonstrate this, we compare the average profile obtained via the committor probability method to standard theory for a given model and find strong agreement, particularly at the core of the bubble. Importantly, we also observe that the behaviour of the committor probability with time is smooth and well defined. This method establishes a robust, simulation-driven framework for studying nucleation dynamics in thermal field theories and may be especially applicable in cases where analytical control might be limited.</div>

In this contribution we present our recent research of the semi-inclusive $(\nu_\mu,\mu p)$ reaction on carbon for the quasielastic and the two-particle-two-hole channels.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neutrino oscillation experiments use Monte Carlo event generators to predict neutrino-nucleus interactions. Cross section uncertainties are typically implemented by varying the parameters of the model(s) used in the generator. We study the performance of two commonly-used model configurations of the GENIE generator (G18_10a_02_11a and AR23_0i_00_000) and their uncertainties by tuning parameters to cross section data, and then comparing the resulting tuned prediction to a suite of other measurements from T2K, MicroBooNE, and MINERvA. This reveals whether the model can simultaneously describe several datasets, as well as whether the uncertainties are adequately robust. We find that G18 and especially AR23 are reasonable in predicting lower-energy measurements from T2K and MicroBooNE, but unable to describe MINERvA data, and discuss the implications for short-baseline oscillation searches. We attempt to replicate a tuning procedure developed by MicroBooNE using several different measurements, and find substantially different results depending on which measurement is used, and that the MicroBooNE tune does not agree with other measurements. We conclude that the SBN experiment should not tune its generator to external data.</div>

Our framework unifies ridge regression, least squares, and prior-informed estimators, and -- using random matrix theory -- yields closed-form risk formulas that expose the bias-variance-prior tradeoff, explain double descent, and quantify prior mismatch. We also identify a closed-form minimizer of test risk, enabling a simple estimator of the optimal regularization parameter. Simulations confirm the theory with high accuracy. By connecting Bayesian priors, classical regularization, and modern asymptotics, our results provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for learning with structured prior knowledge.</div>

Especially, the dependence on the reheating dynamics via w{rh} and the reheating temperature T{rh} is dominating. We give two illustrative examples of w{rh} to discuss its impacts on the total expansion, which can be different as much as 10 even for the same reheating temperature, depending on the shape of w{rh}.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Real-world applications often face scarce labeled data due to the high cost and time requirements of gold-standard experiments, whereas unlabeled data are typically abundant. With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques, it has become increasingly feasible to generate multiple predicted labels using a variety of models and algorithms, including deep learning, large language models, and generative AI. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that safely and adaptively aggregates multiple black-box predictions with unknown quality while preserving valid statistical inference. Our method provides two key guarantees: (i) it never performs worse than using the labeled data alone, regardless of the quality of the predictions; and (ii) if any one of the predictions (without knowing which one) perfectly fits the ground truth, the algorithm adaptively exploits this to achieve either a faster convergence rate or the semiparametric efficiency bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A frequently occurring challenge in experimental and numerical observation is how to resolve features, such as spectral peaks - with center, width, height - and derivatives from measured data with unavoidable noise. Therefore, we develop a modified Whittaker-Henderson smoothing procedure that balances the spectral features and the noise. In our procedure, we introduce adjustable weights that are optimized using cross-validation. When the measurement errors are known, a straightforward error analysis of the smoothed results is feasible. As an example, we calculate the optical group delay dispersion of a Bragg reflector from synthetic phase data with noise to illustrate the effectiveness of the smoothing algorithm. The smoother faithfully reconstructs the group delay dispersion, allowing to observe details that otherwise remain buried in noise. To further illustrate the power of our smoother, we study several commonly occurring difficulties in data and data analysis and show how to properly smoothen unequally sampled data, how to obtain discontinuities, including discontinuous derivatives or kinks, and how to properly smooth data in the vicinity of boundaries to the domains.</div>

Ground-based data were collected in the 2020-2024 time span with the 0.6 m telescope (ADYU60) located at the Adiyaman University Application and Research Center (Adiyaman, T\&#34;{u}rkiye) and the 1.0 m telescope at the T\&#34;{u}rkiye National Observatory (TUG, T\&#34;{u}rkiye). Through a combination of fits to our ground-based data, the mid-transit times data from TESS and additional data taken from the literature, we present an updated linear ephemeris for each system. Transit timing variations (TTVs) were analyzed using linear, orbital decay, and apsidal precession models. The resulting BIC($\Delta$BIC) values indicate that the orbital decay model is statistically favored for HAT-P-16b and TOI-1516b, while the constant period model is preferred for TOI-2046b. False alarm probabilities (FAPs) were computed to assess the significance of any periodic signals. TOI-1516b displays a strong TTV signal with a FAP (of 0.0001) well below the 0.01 threshold, suggesting a likely dynamical origin that warrants further investigation. The higher FAP value (0.0055) for HAT-P-16b suggests that the case of a possible presence of an additional body in the system is less convincing. In contrast, the much higher FAP value (0.0196) for TOI-2046b implies that there are no statistically significant TTVs.</div>

Surrogate models that learn from data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation in the presence of partially missing observations.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives, leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations, and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without objective aggregation.</div>

Leveraging random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees</div>

In this paper, we focus on a Kaluza-Klein model with an extra spatial dimension that compactifies at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) epoch, subject to mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at fixed points. As a consequence, a set of infrared cutoffs naturally emerges in both the scalar and tensor spectra, leading to observable consequences in the CMB. We examine in detail the possible signatures of such a topology, particularly in relation to the even-odd parity imbalance already reported by the COBE, WMAP and Planck missions in the temperature angular correlations at large scales. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the existing Planck E-mode polarization data, and to the high-precision B-mode polarization measurements expected from the forthcoming LiteBIRD mission.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the inference stage with a &#34;thinking longer&#34; paradigm. Even as the foundational reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a model&#39;s performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge the gap between a model&#39;s potential and its actual performance. In this framework, an &#34;explorer&#34; model first generates potential solutions in parallel through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a &#34;synthesizer&#34; model integrates these references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model&#39;s capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a &#34;small-to-big&#34; variant that combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly 30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In contrast to Newtonian physics, there is no absolute time in relativistic (Lorentzian) spacetimes. This immediately implies that two twins may, in general, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course, some asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times are evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent. Our primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some lesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and covariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related misconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox&#39;&#39; may be perfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and does not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of differential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in the prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering several pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that a twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a stronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get younger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker gravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always returns younger than a geodesic one. Finally, we argue that (iv) in a generic spacetime, there is no universal correlation between the phenomena of differential aging and the Doppler effect. Two particularly pedagogical resources provided are a glossary of relevant terms and supplementary Python notebooks in a GitHub repository.</div>

We construct them by tilting independent radial SLEs with a suitable local martingale, generalizing the earlier construction by Healey and Lawler. We prove that the curves are almost surely transient (i.e., they emanate from boundary points and terminate at a common interior target point). We show that they enjoy the resampling property: conditional on all of the curves but one, the remaining curve is distributed as chordal SLE in the remaining domain. We also verify that the multiradial SLE measure satisfies a natural boundary perturbation property analogous to that of the known SLE variants, involving its partition function (which is finite).

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Discrete flow models offer a powerful framework for learning distributions over discrete state spaces and have demonstrated superior performance compared to the discrete diffusion model. However, their convergence properties and error analysis remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a unified framework grounded in stochastic calculus theory to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of discrete flow. Specifically, we derive the KL divergence of two path measures regarding two continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with different transition rates by developing a novel Girsanov-type theorem, and provide a comprehensive analysis that encompasses the error arising from transition rate estimation and early stopping, where the first type of error has rarely been analyzed by existing works. Unlike discrete diffusion models, discrete flow incurs no truncation error caused by truncating the time horizon in the noising process. Building on generator matching and uniformization, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution estimation. Our results provide the first error analysis for discrete flow models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this study, we investigate how the merging process influences the radial variations of the specific Star Formation Rate (sSFR), Star Formation Efficiency (SFE), and molecular gas fraction (fmol ) in galaxies. We analyse 33 isolated galaxies and 34 galaxies in four different merger stages from pairs, merging galaxies, post-mergers, and merger remnants. Our sample is included in the EDGE-CALIFA survey, which provides spatially resolved optical integral-field unit and CO spectroscopy data. We show that, in comparison with the isolated sample, the mergers increase the molecular gas fraction non-uniformly across different galactocentric distances. Also, we find that the main driver (efficiency or molecular gas) of both enhanced and suppressed star formation changes independently of galactocentric radius and merger stage. However, efficiency appears to be the primary driver of variations in star formation (except during the merging stage), where we find an enhancement in star formation driven by the available fuel. Our results suggest that in interacting and merging galaxies, the efficiency plays a crucial role in the star formation variations throughout the galaxy, regardless of the available molecular gas content.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos, governed by a non-holomorphic $A_{4}$ modular flavor symmetry. Within this model framework, the light neutrino masses are generated via the popular type-I seesaw mechanism in which the structure of the Dirac neutrino Yukawa couplings is decided by nonholomorphic modular forms. Unlike conventional flavor models with ad hoc flavon fields, the structure of Dirac and Majorana mass matrices is entirely determined by a modulus parameter $\tau$. We construct the predictive mass matrices for charged leptons, Dirac neutrinos, and right-handed Majorana neutrinos and show the compatibility with neutrino oscillation data by an appropriate choice of input model parameters. We find that our $\chi^2$ analysis of neutrino masses and mixing gives excellent agreement with current neutrino oscillation observables by taking normal hierarchical pattern of light neutrinos. We present numerical analysis of two sets of benchmark points explaining neutrino masses while generating the correct amount of baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. We estimate numerically the values of CP-asymmetry and examine the evolution of the lepton asymmetry by studying Boltzman equations by considering both strong and washout regimes with CP-asymmetry parameter in the range $|\varepsilon_{1}| \sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-8}$. The model predicts an effective Majorana mass in the few meV range, below current experimental bounds but within reach of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches. The key feature of non-holomorphic $A_4$ modular symmetry naturally accommodates non-zero neutrino masses and mixings, minimizes the Yukawa arbitrariness, and establishes a direct connection between high-scale leptogenesis with low-energy neutrino observable parameters, thereby the model provides a testable link between neutrino flavor physics and cosmology.</div>

They conjectured that this identity extends to the broader mixed bias class introduced in Rotnitzky et al. (2021).

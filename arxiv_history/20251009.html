                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Combined survey analyses of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing (3x2-pt studies) will allow new and accurate tests of the standard cosmological model. However, careful validation is necessary to ensure that these cosmological constraints are not biased by uncertainties associated with the modelling of astrophysical or systematic effects. In this study we validate the combined 3x2-pt analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) spectroscopic galaxy clustering and overlapping weak lensing datasets from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC). By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters. This study serves as crucial preparation for the upcoming cosmological parameter analysis of these datasets.</div>

Our estimator supports arbitrary binning in redshift and multipoles $\ell$ and includes cross-correlations of redshift bins. It implements a fully optimal analysis with a pixel-wise covariance model. We implement a number of optimizations which make the estimator and associated covariance matrix computationally tractable for a low-$\ell$ analysis, suitable for example for kSZ velocity reconstruction or primordial non-Gaussianity from scale-dependent bias analyses. We validate our estimator extensively on simulations and compare its features and precision with the common pseudo-$C_\ell$ method, showing significant gains at large scales. We make our code publicly available. In a companion paper, we apply the estimator to kSZ velocity reconstruction using data from ACT and DESI Legacy Survey and construct full set of QML estimators on 40 correlated fields up to $N_{\text{side}}= 32$ in timescale of an hour on a single 24-core CPU requiring $&lt;256\ \mathrm{Gb}$ RAM, demonstrating the performance of the code.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The mildly non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation holds much of the information that upcoming large-scale structure surveys aim to exploit, making fast and accurate predictions on these scales essential. We present the $N$-body module of DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with Jax), designed to deliver high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated, and differentiable particle-mesh simulations tailored for cosmological inference. Theory-informed time integrators such as the recently introduced BullFrog method allow for accurate predictions already with few time steps (e.g. $6$ steps for per-cent-level accuracy in terms of the present-day power spectrum at $k \approx 0.2 \, h / \mathrm{Mpc}$ using $N = 512^3$ particles, which takes just a few seconds). To control discreteness effects and achieve high accuracy, the code incorporates a suite of advanced techniques, for example a custom non-uniform FFT implementation for force evaluation. Both forward- and reverse-mode differentiation are supported, with memory requirements independent of the number of time steps; in the reverse case, this is achieved through an adjoint formulation. We extensively study the effect of various numerical parameters on the accuracy. As an application of DISCO-DJ, we perform field-level inference by recovering $\sigma_8$ and the initial conditions from a noisy Gadget matter density field. Coupled with our recently introduced Einstein--Boltzmann solver, the DISCO-DJ ecosystem provides a self-consistent, fully differentiable pipeline for modelling the large-scale structure of the universe. The code is available at https://github.com/cosmo-sims/DISCO-DJ.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Continual learning, the ability of a model to adapt to an ongoing sequence of tasks without forgetting the earlier ones, is a central goal of artificial intelligence. To shed light on its underlying mechanisms, we analyze the limitations of continual learning in a tractable yet representative setting. In particular, we study one-hidden-layer quadratic neural networks trained by gradient descent on an XOR cluster dataset with Gaussian noise, where different tasks correspond to different clusters with orthogonal means. Our results obtain bounds on the rate of forgetting during train and test-time in terms of the number of iterations, the sample size, the number of tasks, and the hidden-layer size. Our results reveal interesting phenomena on the role of different problem parameters in the rate of forgetting. Numerical experiments across diverse setups confirm our results, demonstrating their validity beyond the analyzed settings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\Omega_m$-$\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\nu&lt;0.17$eV vs. $&lt;0.050$eV under $\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\pm1.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions. Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%, and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.</div>

To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft prompt-generation across different tasks.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\sim35\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\gtrsim 2\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\log(N_{\rm CII}/N_{\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.</div>

An increasing body of research indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and highlight potential challenges.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\lambda=L_\mathrm{X}/M_\star$, and $L_\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\star \approx 10^{11-12}M_\odot$), the occupation fraction is $&gt;93\%$ (a $2\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\%$ ($1\sigma$ errors) between $M_\star\approx10^{9-10}M_\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\star\approx10^{8-9}~M_\odot$. Our results have significant implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness, particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.</div>

This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments providing further optimizations of CUDACPP for GPUs, which I consider ready for inclusion in a new release of the software. The new approach mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which has been so far performed using a single large GPU kernel, into several smaller kernels. I also take this opportunity to describe more in detail some features of the CUDACPP software that are relevant to these new developments and that have not yet been documented.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">From catalogs of gravitational-wave transients, the population-level properties of their sources and the formation channels of merging compact binaries can be constrained. However, astrophysical conclusions can be biased by misspecification or misestimation of the population likelihood. Despite detection thresholds on the false-alarm rate (FAR) or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the current catalog is likely contaminated by noise transients. Further, computing the population likelihood becomes less accurate as the catalog grows. Current methods to address these challenges often scale poorly with the number of events and potentially become infeasible for future catalogs. Here, we evaluate a simple remedy: increasing the significance threshold for including events in population analyses. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we analyze simulated catalogs of up to 1600 gravitational-wave signals from black-hole mergers using full Bayesian parameter estimation with current detector sensitivities. We show that the growth in statistical uncertainty about the black-hole population, as we analyze fewer events but with higher SNR, depends on the source parameters of interest. When the SNR threshold is raised from 11 to 15 -- reducing our catalog size by two--thirds -- we find that statistical uncertainties on the mass distribution only grow by a few 10% and constraints on the spin distribution are essentially unchanged; meanwhile, uncertainties on the high-redshift cosmic merger rate more than double. Simultaneously, numerical uncertainty in the estimate of the population likelihood more than halves, allowing us to ensure unbiased inference without additional computational expense. Our results demonstrate that focusing on higher-significance events is an effective way to facilitate robust astrophysical inference with growing gravitational-wave catalogs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper investigates the energy spectrum of the Dirac oscillator within the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), focusing on two prominent models: the Magueijo--Smolin (MS) and Amelino-Camelia models. We derive the modified Dirac equations in both MS and Amelino-Camelia DSR models under the approximation of $$O(E^{2}/k^{2})$$ for a single particle and examine the resulting energy spectra. The study reveals significant corrections to the standard relativistic Dirac oscillator spectrum due to the Planck-scale deformation parameter $$k$$, which introduces distinct deviations depending on the DSR model employed. For the MS model, we observe non-uniform shifts in both positive and negative energy branches at small $$k$$, with the spectrum gradually flattening toward the canonical result as $$k$$ increases. In the Amelino-Camelia model, the energy levels show larger deviations at lower values of $$k$$, and these anomalies diminish more slowly compared to the MS model. The results provide insights into the impact of quantum gravity effects on quantum systems, with potential applications in high-precision spectroscopic or astrophysical observations at energies near the Planck scale. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of these two DSR models highlights the robustness of Planck-scale predictions and guides future experimental efforts aimed at detecting quantum-gravity signatures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning, and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified, backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment. MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead. On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied agents. Code will be available.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during first-order phase transitions provide a powerful link between the early-universe microphysics and observable signatures today, including dark matter and gravitational waves. In this work we develop a unified description of PBH formation based on the Israel junction conditions, which capture collapse dynamics without relying on conventional overdensity or pressure-balance arguments. As a first application, we show that exotic objects such as Fermi-balls can collapse into PBHs even when most of the vacuum energy is trapped in solitonic cores, leading to a different gravitational-wave signal relative to vacuum-only scenarios. As a second application, we study multiple phase transitions in a hidden sector, which generate correlated gravitational-wave spectra and PBH abundances across transitions. Our framework, while analytically controlled, is broadly applicable to hidden-sector models with general vacuum, radiation, and matter contributions. We present the resulting predictions for PBH mass spectra, dark matter fractions, and gravitational-wave signals, highlighting parameter regions that remain open in current searches and motivating future probes.</div>

The library can run on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The gravitational waveforms emitted by EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact object, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying spacetime. In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions of the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the metric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for timelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\alpha} for both orbits. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a specific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH. The findings show that, for a constant rational integer, {\alpha} has a significant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit. Utilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The waveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital period, influenced by the RSBH parameter {\alpha}. As the system evolves, the phase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced, with cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements in space- based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in leveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties.</div>

FIPs@LHCb continues the successful series of the FIPs workshops, FIPs 2020 and FIPs 2022. The main focus of the workshop was to explore the LHCb potential to search for FIPs thanks to the new software trigger deployed during the recent upgrade. Equally important goals of the workshop were to update the available parameter space in the commonly used FIPs benchmarks by including recent results from the high energy physics community and to discuss recent theory progress necessary for a more accurate definition of observables related to FIP benchmarks.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at $1\lesssim z&lt;7$, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;8.5$) are $30 \pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\sim 1$-$7$ and that this remains relatively stable across $\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent&#39;s potential influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent&#39;s control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further advancing the field of RL.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r &lt; 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} &lt; \lambda/\xi^{2} &lt; 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i) model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning and problem solving.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based filtering, which uses a model&#39;s own confidence - quantified through established uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Methods for solving scientific computing and inference problems, such as kernel- and neural network-based approaches for partial differential equations (PDEs), inverse problems, and supervised learning tasks, depend crucially on the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, the efficacy of such methods, and in particular their accuracy, stability, and generalization properties, strongly depends on the choice of hyperparameters. While bilevel optimization offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step. Our approach provides closed-form updates, eliminating the need for repeated costly PDE solves. As a result, each iteration of the outer loop reduces to a single linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and to PDE inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments highlight substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization. In particular, experiments with additive kernels and neural network-parameterized deep kernels demonstrate the method&#39;s scalability and effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Low rank inference on matrices is widely conducted by optimizing a cost function augmented with a penalty proportional to the nuclear norm $\Vert \cdot \Vert_*$. However, despite the assortment of computational methods for such problems, there is a surprising lack of understanding of the underlying probability distributions being referred to. In this article, we study the distribution with density $f(X)\propto e^{-\lambda\Vert X\Vert_*}$, finding many of its fundamental attributes to be analytically tractable via differential geometry. We use these facts to design an improved MCMC algorithm for low rank Bayesian inference as well as to learn the penalty parameter $\lambda$, obviating the need for hyperparameter tuning when this is difficult or impossible. Finally, we deploy these to improve the accuracy and efficiency of low rank Bayesian matrix denoising and completion algorithms in numerical experiments.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$, of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity ($\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations ($\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our models reproduce this result at $R\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\approx-1$ km/s. In agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models. Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this connection.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Measuring dependence between random variables is a fundamental problem in Statistics, with applications across diverse fields. While classical measures such as Pearson&#39;s correlation have been widely used for over a century, they have notable limitations, particularly in capturing nonlinear relationships and extending to general metric spaces. In recent years, the theory of Optimal Transport and Wasserstein distances has provided new tools to define measures of dependence that generalize beyond Euclidean settings. This survey explores recent proposals, outlining two main approaches: one based on the distance between the joint distribution and the product of marginals, and another leveraging conditional distributions. We discuss key properties, including characterization of independence, normalization, invariances, robustness, sample, and computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an alternative perspective that measures deviation from maximal dependence rather than independence, leading to new insights and potential extensions. Our work highlights recent advances in the field and suggests directions for further research in the measurement of dependence using Optimal Transport.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications. Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift, often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world deployment.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we develop optimal tests for symmetry on the hyper-dimensional torus, leveraging Le Cam&#39;s methodology. We address both scenarios where the center of symmetry is known and where it is unknown. These tests are not only valid under a given parametric hypothesis but also under a very broad class of symmetric distributions. The asymptotic behavior of the proposed tests is studied both under the null hypothesis and local alternatives, and we derive quantitative bounds on the distributional distance between the exact (unknown) distribution of the test statistic and its asymptotic counterpart using Stein&#39;s method. The finite-sample performance of the tests is evaluated through simulation studies, and their practical utility is demonstrated via an application to protein folding data. Additionally, we establish a broadly applicable result on the quadratic mean differentiability of functions, a key property underpinning the use of Le Cam&#39;s approach.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.</div>

This novel feature drastically modifies the geodesic motion of both photons and massive particles, leading to qualitatively new dynamical and observational signatures. We derive and analyze the effective potentials, classify time-like and null geodesics, and identify the conditions for multiple circular orbits. Particular attention is devoted to the photon sphere structure, the associated shadows, and lensing phenomena. Our analysis reveals that, for a broad range of parameters, the black-hole shadow can acquire a two-boundary structure and exhibit additional inner rings, unlike the standard Schwarzschild case. These modifications provide potentially observable imprints of Proca hair in electromagnetic spectra, highlighting the relevance of double-barrier optical phenomena for current and future observations of strong-gravity environments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model&#39;s behavior when scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget? This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a fraction of the computational cost.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization&#39;s test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Parity-odd four-point correlation functions, or trispectra, of cosmic matter density fields provide a unique probe of fundamental symmetries in cosmology. Trispectra of primordial matter density fluctuations produced in the early universe are modified by the subsequent nonlinear structure formation. In this paper, we compute the nonlinear evolution of the parity-odd matter trispectrum to one-loop order, i.e., to third order in density fluctuations, within the framework of effective field theory of the large-scale structure of the universe. By analyzing the different terms in the perturbation series, we demonstrate the structure of infrared divergence cancellations, as required by the equivalence principle. We also derive the forms of the counterterms required to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences. Adopting a specific model for a primordial parity-odd trispectrum, we numerically compute the leading-order effects of nonlinear gravitational evolution and study its impact on baryonic acoustic oscillations within the signal. These calculations are essential for comparing the observed trispectra of nonlinear cosmic density fields with theoretical expectations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z&gt;8$. We present a library of $&gt;175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The decay of the Higgs boson into two photons, $h \to \gamma \gamma$, is a loop-induced process within the Standard Model, predominantly mediated by loops of $W$ bosons and top quarks. While these leading contributions are well understood, the role of hadronic effects, which arise from non-perturbative QCD dynamics, has received less attention, with recent studies reporting puzzling and contradictory results. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ decay width using dispersion relations. Our analysis shows that these contributions are exceedingly small, as expected, altering the decay width by at most about $0.004\%$ under conservative assumptions. Therefore, hadronic effects can be safely neglected even in the context of future high-precision Higgs measurements at current and next-generation colliders.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The correct choice for the matter Lagrangian $(\mathcal{L_{M}})$ in the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, has been a perennial problem. It has been a long-standing issue, whether to choose $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ or $-\rho$ as the proper definition of matter sector. In this work, we summarise that both choices lead to the same energy-momentum tensor. However, for these two choices, the structure of the TOV equations are different. We construct and solve TOV equations using MIT bag model equation of state for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $-\rho$, and study the impact of the choices for matter Lagrangian on the maximum mass limit as well as M-R plot of compact stars. It is interesting to note that allowed range of gravity-matter coupling coefficient is also different for $\mathcal{L_{M}}=p$ and $\mathcal{L_{M}}=-\rho$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Non-global logarithms are low energy correlations between the substructure of a jet and the event in which it is immersed. We study the leading non-global logarithms that arise from soft quark--anti-quark emission and calculate their coefficient as a series in the jet radius, $R$, in arbitrary processes. We calculate the exact coefficient through quadratic order in $R$, and show that this truncation is within $5\%$ of the complete result for radii up to $R = 1$. These quark flavor-dependent non-global logarithms are also responsible for the infrared unsafety of a na\&#34;ive definition of jet flavor that is simply the net sum of quark flavors in the jet of interest. We propose a small modification of this na\&#34;ive jet flavor that we call subtractive jet flavor in which the problematic soft logarithms are explicitly subtracted. We further demonstrate how our analytic results can be interfaced with automated numerical fixed-order codes to extract subtractive jet flavor cross sections.</div>

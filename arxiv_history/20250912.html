                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by estimated supernova magnitudes. Less plausible selection criteria shift $H_0$ by about one standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller error than a previous study using the same data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest standard cosmological model microwave background results. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical modelling.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The void galaxy cross correlation function is a powerful tool to extract cosmological information. Through the void galaxy cross correlation function, cosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for refined deductions of the Universe&#39;s content by correcting apparent geometric distortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the Alcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological reconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically using the Zel&#39;dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies from their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by peculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure the void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space. This approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small nonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the statistical power of void studies and significantly improving their cosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even at small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple environment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales significantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 % improvement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous methods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to a better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters. Our analysis also includes a comprehensive set of consistency checks, demonstrating its robustness. We expect this methodology to yield a substantial gain in constraining power when applied to data from modern large scale structure surveys.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We extend field-level inference to jointly constrain the cosmological parameters $\{A,\omega_{\rm cdm},H_0\}$, in both real and redshift space. Our analyses are based on mock data generated using a perturbative forward model, with noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a constant power spectrum. This idealized setting, where the field-level likelihood is exactly Gaussian, allows us to precisely quantify the information content in the nonlinear field on large scales. We find that field-level inference accurately recovers all cosmological parameters in both real and redshift space, with uncertainties consistent with perturbation theory expectations. We show that these error bars are comparable to those obtained from a joint power spectrum and bispectrum analysis using the same perturbative model. Finally, we perform several tests using the Gaussian field-level likelihood to fit the mock data where the true noise model is non-Gaussian, and find significant biases in the inferred cosmological parameters. These results highlight that the success of field-level inference critically depends on using the correct likelihood, which may be the primary challenge for applying this method to smaller scales even in the perturbative regime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The process of galaxy evolution over cosmic time is not yet fully understood, since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity, including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1 simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and mass at redshifts between 0 &lt; z &lt; 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history between the models and observations.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Accurate modeling of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is essential for extracting reliable information from future space-based gravitational wave observatories. Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online architecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and black hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are generated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter space. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in systematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on radiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i) the intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation of the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to the online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze interpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation schemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \geq 0.9$, we find that $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq 30$ is required for the necessary accuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme, achieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points compared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we demonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum global relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for parameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with SNRs$= \mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative error of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $&lt;10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter estimation biases.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a simple yet effective method to resolve prior-volume effects, also known as projection effects, in full-shape analyses of the power spectrum multipoles within the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). By re-defining the EFTofLSS nuisance parameters to incorporate the contribution from the parameters impacting the amplitude of the EFTofLSS modelling components, we substantially mitigate projection effects. With the re-parametrisation the actual posterior maximum values are within the marginalised credible interval, eliminating significant shifts observed in the baseline analysis. We demonstrate the robustness of this method in full-shape $w_0w_a$CDM analyses on synthetic data in BOSS DR12 and DESI DR1 setups. For the evolving dark energy model, we then analyse the BOSS DR12 measurements, in combination with BAO information (from BOSS DR12, 6DF, SDSS DR7 MGS and eBOSS DR16 surveys) and 3$\times$2pt measurements from DES Y3 -- all data combinations are converging into the $w_0-w_a$ parameter region preferred by DESI+CMB+SNIa. From total combination of these large-scale structure probes without additional CMB information we find $w_0=-0.72 \pm 0.21, \, w_a=-0.91^{+0.78}_{-0.64}$. Despite the low significance of deviation from standard cosmology, this result underscores the potential of our re-parametrisation approach in delivering low-redshift cosmological constraints. We argue for the use of this approach in spectroscopic Stage IV surveys, where the potential deviation from standard cosmology can be detected with higher significance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an investigation into the quenching of simulated galaxies across cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching processes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ref. [Symmetry 15 (2023) 709] introduced a Brans-Dicke-like framework wherein the scalar field $\phi$ is composed of both $G$ and $c$ which, for this reason, co-vary according to $c^{3}/G=\text{constant}$. In this paper, we use observational data to constrain the supposed co-varying $G$ and $c$. The datasets include SN Ia, BAO and the value of $\theta$ extracted from CMB data. A proxy function is demanded for the varying $c$ since the framework does not provide a closed set of equations for computing the functional form of either $G$ or $c$ uniquely. Accordingly, we choose three separate parameterizations for $c\left(z\right)$ inspired both by desirable properties of the varying speed of light (VSL) and by successful phenomenological models from the literature -- including the one by Gupta (CCC framework in e.g. Ref. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 498 (2020) 4481-4491]. When combined with DESI, Pantheon+ data strongly favor a variable speed of light with more than $3\sigma$ confidence level for all parameterizations considered in this paper, whereas Union2.1 suggests no variation of the speed of light. As we shall demonstrate, this apparent discrepancy is due to a strong correlation that emerges between $H_0$ and VSL.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Hubble tension, a persistent discrepancy between early and late Universe measurements of $H_0$, poses a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework designed to meticulously decompose this observed tension into its constituent parts: standard measurement errors, information loss arising from parameter-space projection, and genuine physical tension. Our approach, employing Fisher matrix analysis with MCMC-estimated loss coefficients and explicitly modeling information loss via variance inflation factors ($\lambda$), is particularly important in high-precision analysis where even seemingly small information losses can impact conclusions. We find that the real tension component ($T_{real}$) has a mean value of 5.94 km/s/Mpc (95\% CI: [3.32, 8.64] km/s/Mpc). Quantitatively, approximately 78\% of the observed tension variance is attributed to real tension, 13\% to measurement error, and 9\% to information loss. Despite this, our decomposition indicates that the observed $\sim$$6.39\sigma$ discrepancy is predominantly a real physical phenomenon, with real tension contributing $\sim$$5.64\sigma$. Our findings strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is robust and probably points toward new physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model.</div>

We also look at the effect of a warm dark matter component in the context of coupled quintessence. Analysis using Deviance Information Criterion indicates strong preference for the quintessence model coupled with warm dark matter.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A dedicated analysis of the metric&#39;s derivation confirms the correct form of the magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure reproducibility.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Deviations from the so-called {\it cosmic distance duality relation} may result from systematic errors in distance measurements or, more interestingly, hint at new physics. Further, it can also be related to the Hubble constant tension between early and local measurements of $H_0$. Based on this, we test validity of this relation through a model-independent parameterization of the Hubble rate via the well-estabilished B\&#39;ezier polynomials approach. We seek for possible departures from the relation considering three parametrizations, i) a power-law correction, ii) a logarithmic correction and iii) a Pad\&#39;e series $P_{n,m}(z)$ of order (1;2) with $n=1$ being the order of the numerator while $m=2$ is the order of the denominator. Then, assuming a flat scenario, we test them through Monte Carlo -- Markov chain analyses that combine low- and intermediate/high-$z$ data sets, such as observational Hubble data, the Pantheon catalog of type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, the second data release from the DESI Collaboration and gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we distinguish between \emph{Analysis A} and \emph{Analysis C}, depending whether the prompt emission $E_{iso}-E_p$ or the prompt-afterglow $L_0-E_p-T$ gamma-ray burst correlations, respectively, is fit together with the other probes previously described. Our results seem to point towards a \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality relation and a preference towards Planck&#39;s value of $H_0$.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The reionization optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has interesting connections to existing cosmological anomalies. As first studied in the context of the Hubble tension in our previous paper, a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$, which could be achieved by removing the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data, could boost $H_0$ slightly, resulting in a mild reduction of the tension between the early- and late-universe determinations of $H_0$. It has been shown later that a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the tension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest DESI plus supernovae data&#39;s tension with the standard cosmological constant scenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic observation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients extracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial correlation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of parameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the tensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that allow larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological tensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a result, the relationships between $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not independent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations to clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the effects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The typical galaxy in the local universe is expected to be in a self-regulated quasi-equilibrium, displaying a settled morphology that falls within the Hubble Sequence. The Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs are filled with striking examples of galaxies that defy these expectations, making them useful targets for studying the astrophysics that controls dramatic, but short-lived, episodes of disequilibrium that mark galaxies&#39; evolution. In this paper, we greatly expand the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxies drawn from the Arp and Arp-Madore catalogs. We present new optical F606W images and point-source photometry for 216 systems, whose sizes are well-matched to the Advanced Camera for Surveys&#39; (ACS) wide field of view. Essentially none of the sample had been previously observed with Hubble. The resulting images display rich morphologies, revealing a variety of massive stars, HII regions, stellar clusters, dust lanes, tidal tails, backlit galaxies, and occasional chance superpositions. We provide a pedagogical guide for interpreting highly-resolved optical galaxy images, which has general application beyond this atlas. The atlas images also provide a superb starting point for more detailed studies with high-resolution imaging in other wavelengths, and spectroscopy to track kinematics and the interstellar medium (ISM). Areas of obvious scientific relevance include feedback and star formation in merging and interacting galaxies, resolved stellar populations at the extremes of stellar density, the properties of young massive stars and stellar clusters, the physics of the cold ISM and dust, and stellar and gas dynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an implementation of Quantum Computing for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with an application to cosmological functions, to derive posterior distributions from cosmological probes. The algorithm proposes new steps in the parameter space via a quantum circuit whose resulting statevector provides the components of the shift vector. The proposed point is accepted or rejected via the classical Metropolis-Hastings acceptance method. The advantage of this hybrid quantum approach is that the step size and direction change in a way independent of the evolution of the chain, thus ideally avoiding the presence of local minima. The results are consistent with analyses performed with classical methods, both for a test function and real cosmological data. The final goal is to generalize this algorithm to test its application to complex cosmological computations.</div>

Built on the FleCSI (Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure) framework, HARD expresses its computational units as tasks whose execution can be orchestrated by multiple back-end runtimes, including Legion, MPI, and HPX. Node-level parallelism is delegated to Kokkos, providing a single, portable code base that runs efficiently on laptops, small homogeneous clusters, and the largest heterogeneous supercomputers currently available. To ensure scientific reliability, HARD includes a regression-test suite that automatically reproduces canonical verification problems such as the Sod and LeBlanc shock tubes and the Sedov blast wave, comparing numerical solutions against known analytical results. The project is distributed under an OSI-approved license, hosted on GitHub, and accompanied by reproducible build scripts and continuous integration workflows. This combination of performance portability, verification infrastructure, and community-focused development makes HARD a sustainable platform for advancing radiation hydrodynamics research across multiple domains.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark matter mass density profiles and velocity distributions for a set of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) have recently been obtained (F.Bezrukov, D.Gorbunov, E.Koreshkova arXiv:2412.20585) by performing a multi-parametric fit to the stellar observations with the help of the GravSphere which solves the Jeans equation. We use these results to calculate the geometrical factors for estimation of the fluxes of cosmic rays expected from decay ($D$-factor) and annihilation ($J_s$-, $J_p$- and $J_d$-factors for $s$-, $p$- and $d$- wave processes) of dark matter particles in galaxies. The general novelty is the account for a possible anisotropy in velocities of dark matter particles. On the basis of this analysis we present empirical scaling approximations to these factors as functions of typical observables: distance to the galaxy $d$, it&#39;s half-radius $r_h$ and line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{LOS}$. They can be applied to any galaxy, and for $D$- and $J_s$-factors we refine the estimates of (Andrew B. Pace, Louis E. Strigari arXiv:1802.06811): the shifts in the central values remain within 1-2$\sigma$ error bars.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly advanced the feasibility of Sobol&#39; index computation for computationally expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the existing given-data Sobol&#39; index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks, which have $&gt;10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods. Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol&#39; index estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can introduce significant bias into Sobol&#39; index estimates even at large sample sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two application problems in neural network modeling.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The goal of the present paper is to assess the usefulness of quasars as cosmological distance indicators. We calibrate, in a model-independent way, the non-linear relation between X-ray and UV emission to derive quasar luminosity distances. Using this calibration, we construct the Hubble diagram up to redshift $z \sim 7.5$, and test the ability of quasars to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega$CDM models at low and high redshifts, in combination with the Type Ia supernova Pantheon Plus sample, as well as the latest results from DESI and Planck Compressed data. We find consistency with previous studies in the values of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ when using a quasar subsample with $z&lt;1.43$. However, when the data is used to constrain the cosmological models, we find that quasars fail as reliable distance indicators, even when combined with other independent cosmological datasets.</div>

We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate a class of interacting dark energy and dark matter (DM) models, where dark energy is modeled as a $k$-essence scalar field with an inverse-square potential. Two general forms of interaction are considered: one proportional to the Hubble parameter, and another independent of the Hubble parameter, depending instead on combinations of the energy densities and pressures of the dark sectors. The dynamics are analyzed using a dynamical system stability framework by constructing an autonomous system of equations. The models are tested against a wide range of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), BAO measurements from DESI DR2, compressed Planck data (PLA), Pantheon+ (PP), DES supernovae, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and strong lensing data from H0LiCOW (HCW). The analysis shows that the models consistently reproduce all major cosmological epochs and yield statistically competitive results compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The models exhibit stable late-time de-Sitter solutions, ensuring ghost-free evolution, with the Hubble constant in the range $H_0 \sim 67$--$70$ km/s/Mpc.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited. In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training. We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and empirically, showing that it can extend the model&#39;s fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the era of increasing synthetic data.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The epoch of reionization (EoR) marks the last phase transition of hydrogen in our Universe, as it evolves from cold and neutral to hot and ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). While its endpoint and duration can be estimated from current observations, albeit with large uncertainties, there is no known avenue to constrain its onset. We propose a novel method based on the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient between 21-cm brightness temperature maps and line-intensity maps tracing star-formation (e.g., OIII, CO, CII). This real-space estimator evolves from negative to positive as X-ray heating progresses, and saturates prior to the EoR. We predict a sharp turnover from saturation during the earliest EoR stages, when the IGM ionized fraction reaches $\bar{x}_{\rm HII}\sim 1\%-10\%$. We show that in standard scenarios, where the IGM heating precedes reionization, the turnover is a clear, model-robust signature. Its detection will provide a unique observational anchor for the EoR onset, complementing existing probes and tightening constraints on early galaxy formation models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We explore the possibility of axion-photon conversion as a common origin of two low-frequency anomalies: the isotropic radio excess (ARCADE2) and the deep global 21-cm absorption trough (EDGES). From the axion-photon action in an FLRW background with primordial magnetic fields (PMFs), we derive the scale-dependent conversion probability including plasma effects. Resonant conversion, arising when the axion mass matches the plasma-induced photon mass, produces soft photons in the MHz-GHz range. By modeling stochastic PMFs with amplitude $B_0$ and spectral index $n_{\rm B}$, we show that axion-like particles with mass $\sim 10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and nanogauss-level nearly scale invariant PMFs can explain both ARCADE2 and EDGES. Heating from PMF dissipation via ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay reduces the 21-cm trough, shifting the viable parameter space. Our results stem from a consistent theoretical framework developed from first principles and a combined analysis of the radio excess and global 21-cm signal, while remaining consistent with CMB bounds on PMFs and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. We conclude that global 21-cm observations may offer potential sensitivity to axions, primordial magnetism, and dark-sector physics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a microscopic calculation of two particle-two hole meson exchange current response functions in asymmetric nuclei, with particular emphasis on the $^{40}$Ar nucleus. Employing a relativistic mean-field and relativistic Fermi gas framework, we compute the nuclear response for $^{40}$Ar and compare it with that of the symmetric $^{40}$Ca nucleus, analyzing the role of proton-neutron imbalance. The model incorporates distinct proton and neutron Fermi momenta to accurately capture the nuclear dynamics of systems with $Z \neq N$. Our results indicate that using $^{40}$Ca as a proxy for $^{40}$Ar leads to a systematic error of approximately 10\%. Additionally, we propose an asymmetric scaling formula to obtain the 2p2h response for arbitrary nuclei from the $^{12}$C response, improving the description of asymmetric nuclei. Finally, we benchmark our predictions against inclusive electron scattering and neutrino cross sections.</div>

This work examines Einstein-Cartan theory against McKeon et al.&#39;s claims~\cite{BrandtFrenkelMcKeon2024,McKeonBrandtFrenkel2025} regarding its viability for unification. McKeon et al.&#39;s 2024 analysis omitted key interaction terms, missing Einstein-Cartan&#39;s central content. Their 2025 claim that unification requires Einstein-Cartan is incorrect. When fermions are included, Einstein-Cartan generates non-renormalizable four-fermion interactions producing catastrophic quartic divergences $\sim \kappa^4\Lambda^4$. Precision experiments exclude the theory: MICROSCOPE constrains equivalence principle violations at $10^{-15}$ while Einstein-Cartan predicts $10^{-12}$ effects. In contrast to these claims, the USMEG-EFT framework achieves unification using standard 4D GR through constraints, producing finite results with calculable coefficients while remaining experimentally compatible.</div>

This gravitational theory results in general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Building on our previous work, where we constructed its static spherically symmetric solutions in the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) background (Eur. Phys. J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the system&#39;s thermodynamics. We examine the thermodynamic properties of the Einstein-Geometric Proca AdS compact objects, focusing on the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, heat capacity, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Particular attention is given to the dependence of the Hawking temperature, enthalpy, and heat capacity on the uniform potential $q_{1}$ and the electromagnetic-type charge $q_{2}$. Through numerical analysis we compute the entropy and Gibbs free energy and investigate how these quantities vary with the model parameters.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version. First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for Computing with Words applications.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}&#39;$ against a null distribution $\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models, we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under $\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds, and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic block models, and seriation models.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</div>

(2021). Building on this framework, we propose a quantile-based variant, the quantile fractional generalized cumulative past entropy (QFGCPE), along with its dynamic time-dependent counterpart (DQFGCPE). Closed-form expressions of these measures are derived analytically for a variety of lifetime distributions, including those with and without explicit distribution functions. Fundamental properties such as bounds, monotonicity, and stochastic orderings are investigated to assess robustness and interpretability. Furthermore, we construct a nonparametric estimator of QFGCPE and establish its asymptotic validity through extensive simulation studies involving bias, mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed QFGCPE measure is examined by comparing its behavior with the logistic map, demonstrating its ability to capture transitions from order to chaos.</div>

Focusing on the $R+R^{2}+RR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ case, we obtain linearized equations in the parameter $\gamma_{0}$ and analyze the resulting phase space. The model exhibits the main desirable features of an inflationary regime, with a slow-roll attractor and a stable critical point corresponding to the end of inflation. Analytical expressions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ show that the model is consistent with Planck, BICEP/Keck, and BAO data if $|\gamma_{0}|\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Moreover, negative values of $\gamma_{0}$ restore compatibility with recent ACT, Planck and DESI results, suggesting that higher-order corrections may play a relevant role in refining inflationary cosmology.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Astronauts participating in deep-space exploration missions will be exposed to significantly greater amounts of radiation than is typically encountered on Earth or in low Earth orbit (LEO), which poses significant risks to crew health and mission safety. Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz deflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses with lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active shielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations, which are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of shield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and Energy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method by which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various simplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy, and therefore require evaluation and correction. In this work, a number of aspects of the original semi-analytical model are updated and validated by Monte Carlo simulation, then used to recharacterize the design trade space of solenoidal magnetic shields. The updated model predicts improved performance for weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished performance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m. Overall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass savings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose reduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most exploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside LEO.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Merger gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescence carry rich information about the underlying spacetime dynamics. We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances. Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away. Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function estimator&#39;s ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator (WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.</div>

This unprecedented precision enables a rich physics programme, including high-precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. In this paper we demonstrate nuSTORM&#39;s sensitivity to key Standard Model processes such as, measurements of the weak mixing angle at low $Q^2$ and the rare process of neutrino trident production. We also show its powerful reach for a diverse range of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, including eV-scale sterile neutrinos, Kaluza-Klein excitations from large extra dimensions and lepton flavour violation. Furthermore, nuSTORM can place significant constraints on heavy QCD axions and other axion-like particles produced in rare kaon decays.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments. We hope this work will benefit the research community with a neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page can be found at Github.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a new amorphous dust emission model based on the soft-potential (SP) model, applicable in the long-wavelength range from the far-infrared to the microwave. The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain amorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS) model, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP model, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a double-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric interaction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of the amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical solutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these results, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential barrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed spectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the conventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain various long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening in the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to the TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and laboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model.</div>

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Competition. The dataset included 195,789 customer IDs, and we employed a 16-step design and statistical analysis to ensure the final pipeline was robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second place in the competition.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dwarf-dwarf galaxy encounters are a key aspect of galaxy evolution as they can ignite or temporarily suppress star formation in dwarfs and can lead to dwarf mergers. However, the frequency and impact of dwarf encounters remain poorly constrained due to limitations of spectroscopic studies, e.g. surface-brightness incompleteness of optical studies and poor spatial resolution of single-dish neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples using the untargeted, interferometric Apertif HI survey and study the impact of the interaction on star formation rates of galaxies as a function of the on-sky separation. Our parent dwarf sample consists of 2481 gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses 10^6 &lt; M_* / M_Sun &lt; 5*10^9, for which we identify close companions based on projected separation (r_p) and systemic velocity difference (Del_V_sys). We explore both constant thresholds for r_p and Del_V_sys corresponding to 150 kpc and 150 km/s on all galaxies in our sample, and mass-dependent thresholds based on a stellar-to-halo mass relation. We find the average number of companions per dwarf in our sample to be 13% (20%) when considering mass-dependent (constant) thresholds. In the stellar mass regime of 2*10^8 &lt; M_* / M_Sun &lt; 5*10^9, we find a three times higher frequency (11.6%) of dwarf companions than previously determined from optical spectroscopic studies, highlighting the power of HI for finding dwarf multiples. Furthermore, we find evidence for an increase in star formation rates (SFRs) of close dwarf galaxy pairs of galaxies with similar stellar masses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present monitoring observations of quasar microlensing in the quadruple quasar HE0435-1223. The microlensing-induced light curves of the quasar images are chromatic, i.e. they depend on the applied filter band. Comparison with microlensing simulations allows us to infer properties of the accretion disk. We determine the R and V band light curves of the four images of HE0435-1223 from 79 and 80 epochs respectively, taken from 2014 to 2024 at the Las Cumbres Observatory using difference imaging analysis. We consider difference light curves to remove the intrinsic quasar variability. This reveals a prominent long-term chromatic microlensing event in image B. We use microlensing light curve simulations with both Gaussian and standard thin accretion disk brightness profiles to analyse this signal. The particularly strong signal observed in image B of HE0435-1223 makes it possible to detect a size ratio of the accretion disk in the R band compared to the V band of $1.24^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.22}$ for the Gaussian and the thin disk model, respectively. These values are in agreement with standard thin disk theory. For the absolute size we find large disk half-light radii of around 0.7 to 1.0 Einstein radii with an uncertainty of about 0.6 dex (depending on the filter bands and the models). Finally, our calculations show that image B undergoes caustic crossings about once per year.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The fundamental process of star formation in galaxies involves the interplay between the fueling of star formation via molecular gas and the feedback from recently formed massive stars. This process, by which galaxies evolve, is also closely connected to the intrinsic properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). To study the role that different molecular and atomic phases of the ISM play in star formation, and to characterize their physical conditions, we zoom into our nearest neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 50 kpc). The LMC offers a view of the ISM and star formation conditions in a low metallicity environment similar to, in that regard, the epoch of the peak of star formation in the earlier universe. We present an unprecedentedly detailed analysis of a well-known star-forming regions (SFRs) at a spatial resolution of a few pc. We mapped a 610pcx260pc region in the LMC molecular ridge in [CII] and the [OIII] using the FIFI-LS instrument on the SOFIA telescope. We compare the data with the distribution of the CO (2-1) emission from ALMA, the modeled TIR luminosity as well as Spitzer/MIPS continuum and Halpha. We also provide a detailed description of the observing strategy and the data reduction. We find that [CII] and [OIII] emission is associated with the SFRs in the molecular ridge, but also extends throughout the mapped region, not obviously associated with ongoing star formation. The CO emission is clumpier than the [CII] emission and we find plentiful [CII] present where there is little CO emission, possibly holding important implications for CO-dark gas. We find a clear trend of the [CII]/TIR ratio decreasing with increasing TIR. This suggests a strong link between the [CII]-deficit and the local physical conditions instead of global properties.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We show that a minimally extended varying-speed-of-light (meVSL) cosmology can alleviate the Hubble tension through a single parameter, b. This parameter both shortens the sound horizon at the drag epoch and modifies cosmological time dilation for transients, Delta_t_obs=(1+z)^n Delta_t_emit with n=1-b/4. The reduction in r_d raises the early-universe-inferred H_0 from CMB/BAO analyses, while departures of n from unity provide an independent, time-domain probe of b. Using Fisher forecasts for a DES-like survey, we estimate the supernova sample size required to detect sub-percent deviations in n under realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties. For illustration, b=0.03 yields z_drag = 1108 and r_d = 135 Mpc, consistent with H_0=~73 km/s/Mpc. We conclude that current and upcoming time-domain surveys can place competitive constraints on b and, jointly with CMB/BAO, provide a self-consistent observational test of meVSL&#39;s ability to alleviate the H_0 discrepancy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Future lunar missions will depend on an internationally agreed upon timescale that remains accurate under the Moon&#39;s unique gravitational environment and its orbital dynamics. This thesis investigates the proposed Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL), derived analogously to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and thus aligned with current IAU proposals. We first formalise the TCL transformation and quantify its characteristics from solar system simulations. Next, we compute stationary surface-clock drifts caused by gravitational redshift and the Moon&#39;s changing orientation parameters, evaluating how accurate atomic clocks deployed on the surface of the Moon (much like for ESA&#39;s proposed NovaMoon mission) would have to be to measure these effects. Finally, we simulate relativistic proper time for ESA&#39;s Moonlight navigation satellites, identifying average drift and harmonic variations, to better understand the system that will comprise and enable a Lunar PNT (Positioning, Navigation and Timing) architecture. These kinds of investigations are an essential step toward a sustained internationally cooperative operation at the lunar south pole and beyond.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) provide a powerful, independent method to measure the Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, through time delays between their multiple images. The accuracy of this measurement depends critically on both the precision of time delay estimation and the robustness of lens modeling. In many current cluster-scale modeling algorithms, all multiple images used for modeling are simplified as point sources to reduce computational costs. In the first paper of the CURLING program, we demonstrated that such a point-like approximation can introduce significant uncertainties and biases in both magnification reconstruction and cosmological inference. In this study, we explore how such simplifications affect $H_0$ measurements from glSNe. We simulate a lensed supernova at $z=1.95$, lensed by a galaxy cluster at $z=0.336$, assuming time delays are measured from LSST-like light curves. The lens model is constructed using JWST-like imaging data, utilizing both Lenstool and a pixelated method developed in CURLING. Under a fiducial cosmology with $H_0=70\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, the Lenstool model yields $H_0=69.91^{+6.27}_{-5.50}\rm \ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$, whereas the pixelated framework improves the precision by over an order of magnitude, $H_0=70.39^{+0.82}_{-0.60}\rm \ km \ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$. Our results indicate that in the next-generation observations (e.g., JWST), uncertainties from lens modeling dominate the error budget for $H_0$ inference, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the extended surface brightness of multiple images to fully leverage the potential of glSNe for cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding how galaxies assemble their mass during the first billion years of cosmic time is a central goal of extragalactic astrophysics, yet joint constraints on their sizes and kinematics remain scarce. We present one of the first statistical studies of the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ size-mass relation at high redshift with a sample of 213 galaxies at spectroscopic redshifts of $z\approx 4-6$ from the FRESCO and CONGRESS NIRCam grism surveys. We measure the $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ morphology and kinematics of our sample using the novel forward modelling Bayesian inference tool $\texttt{geko}$, and complement them with stellar continuum sizes in the rest-frame FUV, NUV, and optical, obtained from modelling of imaging data from the JADES survey with $\texttt{Pysersic}$. At $z\approx5$, we find that the average H$\alpha$ sizes are larger than the stellar continuum (FUV, NUV and optical), with $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}= 1.17 \pm 0.05$ kpc and $r_{\rm e,cont} \approx 0.9$ kpc for galaxies with $\log(M_{\star} ~\rm [M_{\odot}])= 9.5$. However, we find no significant differences between the stellar continuum sizes at different wavelengths, suggesting that galaxies are not yet steadily growing inside-out at these epochs. Instead, we find that the ratio $r_{\rm e, H\alpha}/r_{\rm e, NUV}$ increases with the distance above the star-forming main sequence ($\Delta \rm MS$), consistent with an expansion of H$\alpha$ sizes during episodes of enhanced star formation caused by an increase in ionising photons. As galaxies move above the star-forming main sequence, we find an increase of their rotational support $v/\sigma$, which could be tracing accreting gas illuminated by the \Ha\ emission. Finally, we find that about half of the elongated systems ($b/a &lt; 0.5$) are not rotationally supported, indicating a potential flattened/prolate galaxy population at high redshift.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">(Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($&lt;1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel&#39;dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.</div>

The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range $10^4 &lt; M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot &lt; 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment.

Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recently, we proposed a novel charged wormhole spacetime based on Yoshiaki Sofue&#39;s exponential dark matter density profile, referred to as the Charged Galactic Wormhole. Our previous work explored the deflection of light and massive chargeless particles in this spacetime. Building upon this foundation, we now extend our study to investigate the deflection of charged massive particles around the charged galactic wormhole, unveiling new insights and opening several promising avenues for future research. To analyze this phenomenon, we employ two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes the Rindler-Ishak method, leveraging the Jacobi metric to compute the particle trajectories with high precision. The second approach adopts the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, providing a geometric and topological perspective of the deflection process. A detailed comparison of the results from these two approaches is presented, highlighting their consistency and differences, along with the physical implications. This work provides deeper insights into the interaction of gravitational and electromagnetic forces around charged galactic wormholes and their influence on particle motion, contributing to the theoretical understanding of such exotic spacetime structures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Methods for split conformal prediction leverage calibration samples to transform any prediction rule into a set-prediction rule that complies with a target coverage probability. Existing methods provide remarkably strong performance guarantees with minimal computational costs. However, they require to use calibration samples composed by labeled examples different to those used for training. This requirement can be highly inconvenient, as it prevents the use of all labeled examples for training and may require acquiring additional labels solely for calibration. This paper presents an effective methodology for split conformal prediction with unsupervised calibration for classification tasks. In the proposed approach, set-prediction rules are obtained using unsupervised calibration samples together with supervised training samples previously used to learn the classification rule. Theoretical and experimental results show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to that with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in performance guarantees and computational efficiency.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves (GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time- and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\odot}$, the optimal regime for testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of gravity and BHs with GW observations.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A central challenge in high-energy nuclear physics is to extract informative features from the high-dimensional final-state data of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) in order to enable reliable downstream analyses. Traditional approaches often rely on selected observables, which may miss subtle but physically relevant structures in the data. To address this, we introduce a Transformer-based autoencoder trained with a two-stage paradigm: self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. The pretrained encoder learns latent representations directly from unlabeled HIC data, providing a compact and information-rich feature space that can be adapted to diverse physics tasks. As a case study, we apply the method to distinguish between large and small collision systems, where it achieves significantly higher classification accuracy than PointNet. Principal component analysis and SHAP interpretation further demonstrate that the autoencoder captures complex nonlinear correlations beyond individual observables, yielding features with strong discriminative and explanatory power. These results establish our two-stage framework as a general and robust foundation for feature learning in HIC, opening the door to more powerful analyses of quark--gluon plasma properties and other emergent phenomena. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Giovanni-Sforza/MaskPoint-AMPT.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, such as the classical BPT, are widely used to identify ionisation mechanisms in galaxies but often suffer from degeneracies, especially when multiple sources coexist. We critically evaluate the effectiveness of these diagnostics in distinguishing star-forming galaxies, retired galaxies (RGs), and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and propose refined methods to reduce misclassifications. Using a large sample of nearby galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas cross-matched with SDSS spectroscopy, we define representative subsamples of late-type/star-forming galaxies, early-type/RGs, and multiwavelength-selected AGNs. Their distributions are analysed across traditional and modern diagnostics, including WHaN, WHaD, and the newly introduced WHaO diagram, which combine H{\alpha} equivalent width with [N II]/H{\alpha}, {\sigma}(H{\alpha}), and [O III]/[O II], respectively. Quantitative comparisons reveal that classical BPT diagrams overestimate star-forming galaxies by ~10% and misclassify up to 45% of AGNs and nearly all RGs. Diagnostics incorporating EW(H{\alpha}) achieve improved accuracy, reducing misclassifications to {\sim} 20\ % for AGNs and {\sim} 15\% for RGs. A revised classification scheme based on EW(H{\alpha}) thresholds and consistent WHaD/WHaO results yields the highest purity (8-25% misclassifications) and better reflects underlying physical conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that BPT-based methods fail to reliably separate ionisation mechanisms, particularly in galaxies hosting weak AGNs or evolved stellar populations. Updated EW(H{\alpha})-based diagnostics offer a more accurate framework for studying galaxy ionisation and should replace traditional schemes in future population studies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) surveys usually require extensive observational baselines to confirm planetary candidates, making them resource-intensive. Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising candidate signals before further observational investment, but their effectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter. In this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a Transformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of planetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar activity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists and assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins. Injection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets from NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems ($&lt;$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a factor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the period and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing multi-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with semi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and irregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital periods. These results underscore the potential of machine learning to identify planetary candidates early in EPRV surveys, even from limited observational counts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population. Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Today&#39;s AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and $(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation, agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training wheels&#39;&#39; protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for researchers.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D&gt;4$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V&#39;&#39;-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</div>

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns to orchestrate a set of such expert policies, leveraging their complementary strengths in a data-driven, adaptive manner. Building on the Adv2 framework (Jonckheere et al., 2024), our method combines expert decisions through advantage-based weight updates and extends naturally to settings where only estimated value functions are available. We establish both expectation and high-probability regret guarantees and derive a novel finite-time bias bound for temporal-difference learning, enabling reliable advantage estimation even under constant step size and non-stationary dynamics. To support scalability, we introduce a neural actor-critic architecture that generalizes across large state spaces while preserving interpretability. Simulations on stochastic matching models, including an organ exchange scenario, show that the orchestrated policy converges faster and yields higher system level efficiency than both individual experts and conventional RL baselines. Our results highlight how structured, adaptive learning can improve the modeling and management of complex resource allocation and decision-making processes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Enhanced sampling has achieved considerable success in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of rare events. Metadynamics (MetaD), owing to its excellent compatibility with MD engines, became one of the most popular enhanced sampling methods. With the boom of GPU computing and the advent of machine learning potentials (MLPs), high-accuracy, large-scale MD simulations have gradually become feasible. However, the corresponding GPU-based enhanced sampling tools have not yet been well adapted to this progress. To enable full-life-cycle GPU MetaD simulations, we propose the GPU Sampling MetaD (GSM) package. By leveraging MLPs, it is feasible to perform high-precision rare event sampling for systems comprising millions of atoms on a typical single GPU, which offers a potential solution to many size-dependent problems. By conducting sampling in several classical systems, the results sufficiently demonstrate the capability of this package to simulate diverse atomic systems, especially efficient in large scale systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to +4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to +12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs&#39; reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gaussian mixture models are widely used to model data generated from multiple latent sources. Despite its popularity, most theoretical research assumes that the labels are either independent and identically distributed, or follows a Markov chain. It remains unclear how the fundamental limits of estimation change under more complex dependence. In this paper, we address this question for the spherical two-component Gaussian mixture model. We first show that for labels with an arbitrary dependence, a naive estimator based on the misspecified likelihood is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Additionally, under labels that follow an Ising model, we establish the information theoretic limitations for estimation, and discover an interesting phase transition as dependence becomes stronger. When the dependence is smaller than a threshold, the optimal estimator and its limiting variance exactly matches the independent case, for a wide class of Ising models. On the other hand, under stronger dependence, estimation becomes easier and the naive estimator is no longer optimal. Hence, we propose an alternative estimator based on the variational approximation of the likelihood, and argue its optimality under a specific Ising model.</div>

Valuable insights into this regime can be gained using low-energy models. This, however, requires a careful assessment of model artifacts. We therefore study the effects of renormalization and in-medium modifications of quark-meson interaction on the moat regime. To capture the main effects, we use a two-flavor quark-meson model at finite temperature and baryon density in the random phase approximation. We put forward a convenient renormalization scheme to account for the nontrivial momentum dependence of meson self-energies and discuss the role of renormalization conditions for renormalization group consistent results on the moat regime. In addition, we demonstrate and that its extent in the phase diagram critically depends on the interaction of quarks and mesons.</div>

We develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using a hierarchical Dirichlet process as a prior on the parameters of a Switching Linear Dynamical System and a Gaussian process prior to model the statistical variations in amplitude and temporal alignment within each cluster. By modeling the evolution of time series patterns, the method avoids unnecessary proliferation of clusters in a principled manner. We perform inference by formulating a variational lower bound for off-line and on-line scenarios, enabling efficient learning through optimization. We illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the approach through several case studies of electrocardiogram analysis using publicly available databases.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The migration of planets within their nascent protoplanetary disks is a fundamental process that shapes the final architecture of planetary systems. However, studying this phenomenon through direct hydrodynamical simulations is computationally demanding, with traditional methods on fixed grids being ill-suited for tracking planet migration over long timescales due to their high cost and limited domain. In this work, we present a self-consistent comoving framework designed to overcome these challenges. Our method employs a coordinate transformation that scales with the planet&#39;s evolving semi-major axis, keeping the planet stationary with respect to its local computational grid. This transforms the standard hydrodynamic equations by introducing a source term that accounts for the inertial forces of the non-inertial reference frame. We implement this framework in the FARGO3D code and validate it through a benchmark test, demonstrating excellent agreement with conventional fixed-grid simulations until the latter are compromised by boundary effects. Our analysis shows that the comoving method can be over an order of magnitude more computationally efficient, dramatically reducing the cost of simulating migrating planets. Furthermore, the framework&#39;s adaptability enables efficient, high-resolution studies of planets on eccentric orbits by keeping them stationary within the computational grid. This framework serves as both a powerful numerical and theoretical tool, simplifying the time-dependent flow around a migrating planet that offers clearer physical insight. It enables long-term, self-consistent studies of planet-disk interaction, representing a crucial step towards performing planet-population synthesis based on full hydrodynamical simulations.</div>

In the coming years detectors of this type will become sensitive to solar neutrino scattering. Previous work has shown that, for dark matter scattering at very low recoil energies, one must include collective excitations of the electrons in the solid. In this work, we have computed the collective excitations due to neutrino scattering on electrons and nuclei. We find the full electron-scattering response at leading order is captured by 5 structure factors and identify the leading component with the electron energy-loss function. Then, using silicon and germanium detectors as an example, we perform a dark matter sensitivity study and compute their respective neutrino floors. Lastly, we show that these detectors are sensitive to unexplored scenarios of beyond-Standard Model neutrino physics, within the exposure required to reach the neutrino floor.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar streams are sensitive to perturbations from, e.g., giant molecular clouds, bars and spiral arms, infalling dwarf galaxies, or globular clusters which can imprint gaps, clumps, spurs, and asymmetries in tails. In addition to these effects, the impact of a galactic major merger on a population of stellar streams remains to be explored. Here, we focus on the emergence and longevity of asymmetries between the leading and trailing tails of streams caused by such interactions. We run collisionless N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy hosting 36 globular cluster streams and merging with a perturber galaxy. We propose a new asymmetry metric to quantify the structural differences between both tails from their respective cumulative density profiles. We find that the over- and under-densities along streams induced by the merger depend on the orbital characteristics of their progenitors. The non-simultaneity of this effect from stream to stream implies that global asymmetry signatures are less prominent than in individual cases. These population-averaged imprints remain detectable over only 2.5 Gyr but asymmetric signatures can persist over much longer periods for individual streams with wide orbits that have been perturbed prior to coalescence. We thus caution that the interpretation of streams&#39; morphology in the context of dark matter mapping is strongly subject to degeneracies and should be performed considering the merger history of the host.</div>

It was made possible by generational triumphs of accelerator art and experimental technique, and by human resourcefulness and collaboration on a global scale, all sustained by the enlightened support of many governments and institutions. Some imagine that, once the keystone of the standard model of particle physics has been set, our subject is over.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a geometric hypothesis for neutrino mixing: twice the sum of the three mixing angles equals $180^\circ$, forming a Euclidean triangle. This condition leads to a predictive relation among the mixing angles and, through trigonometric constraints, enables reconstruction of the mass-squared splittings. The hypothesis offers a phenomenological resolution to the $\theta_{23}$ octant ambiguity, reproduces the known mass hierarchy patterns, and suggests a normalized geometric structure underlying the PMNS mixing. We show that while an order-of-magnitude scale mismatch remains (the absolute splittings are underestimated by $\sim 10\times$), the triangle reproduces mixing ratios with notable accuracy, hinting at deeper structural or symmetry-based origins. We emphasize that the triangle relation is advanced as an empirical, phenomenological organizing principle rather than a result derived from a specific underlying symmetry or dynamics. It is testable and falsifiable: current global-fit values already lie close to satisfying the condition, and improved precision will confirm or refute it.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the $10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} &lt; -17$. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that $75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Jet substructure provides one of the most exciting new approaches for searching for physics in and beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Modern jet substructure searches are often performed with Neural Network (NN) taggers which study the jets&#39; radiation distributions in great detail, far beyond what is theoretically described by parton shower generators. While this represents a great opportunity, as NNs look deeper into the structure of jets they become increasingly sensitive both to perturbative and non-perturbative theoretical uncertainties. It is therefore important to be able to control which aspects of both regimes the networks focus on, and to develop techniques for quantifying these uncertainties. In this paper we take two steps in this direction: First, we introduce EnFNs, a generalization of the Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) which directly probes higher point correlations in jets, as motivated by recent advances in the study of energy correlators. Second, we introduce a number of techniques to quantify and visualize their robustness to non-perturbative corrections. We highlight the importance of such considerations in a toy study incorporating systematics into a search, and maximizing for the network&#39;s discovery significance, as opposed to absolute tagging performance. We hope this study continues the interest in understanding the role QCD systematics play in Machine Learning applications and opens the door to a better interplay between theory and experiment in HEP.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The article is devoted to the systematic derivation of new representations of the Hu-Meyer formulas. The formula expressing a multiple Wiener stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Stratonovich stochastic integrals and the formula expressing a multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral through the sum of multiple Wiener stochastic integrals are derived for the case of a multidimensional Wiener process. The proof method proposed by the author in 2006 is applied. At that a different definition of the multiple Stratonovich stochastic integral and other sufficient conditions for the validity of the Hu-Meyer formulas (compared to known analogues) are used. Of great importance for the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations is the verification of sufficient conditions for the applicability of the Hu-Meyer formula for the case of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with respect to components of a multidimensional Wiener process. In the author&#39;s previous works, the indicated conditions were verified for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 (the case of an arbitrary basis in the Hilbert space) and for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 7 and 8 (the case of two special bases in Hilbert space (the trigonometric Fourier basis and the basis of Legendre polynomials)). Therefore, the results of the article will be usefull for constructing high-order strong numerical methods for non-commutative systems of Ito stochastic differential equations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the properties of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) in the low surface brightness galaxy AGC 223218. The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ring systems have recently been discovered around several small bodies in the outer Solar System through stellar occultations. While such measurements provide key information on ring geometry and dynamical interactions, little is known about their composition, grain size distribution, origin, lifetime, or evolutionary pathways. Here we report near-infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of a stellar occultation by the Centaur (10199) Chariklo, providing unprecedented constraints on the material properties of a small-body ring system and offering insights into their origin and evolution. These measurements reveal that Chariklo&#39;s inner dense ring contains predominantly micrometer-sized particles and exhibits a significant increase in opacity compared to previous observations, suggesting active replenishment events. Most strikingly, the outer ring shows a much weaker near-infrared occultation signature than in earlier visible-light detections. This discrepancy may indicate ongoing material loss, implying that the outer ring is transient, or it may reflect wavelength-dependent opacity consistent with a dusty structure dominated by $0.2$-$0.5$ $\mu$m silicate grains. These scenarios, not mutually exclusive, point to an unprecedented level of complexity in small-body ring systems, unlike anything observed around other minor bodies in the Solar System.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the dynamics of the Bianchi~I cosmological model in the presence of both polymer quantization effects and an exponential deformation of the Poisson algebra. Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the polymer-deformed equations of motion and analyze their solutions for the contracting branch of the model. In contrast with the undeformed classical dynamics, the exponential deformation with suitable values of deformation parameters, produces a noticeably slower evolution of the volume variable and leads to a stabilization of the anisotropy parameters, which remain bounded throughout the evolution. No removal of the initial singularity is observed; however, the deformation significantly modifies the asymptotic behavior, offering a mechanism to suppress anisotropic shear near the singularity. Our results are illustrated through analytic solutions, highlighting the qualitative differences between the standard and the polymer--deformed Bianchi~I cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts; reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack: incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design, rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate computation with respect to complexity.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We analyze JWST spectroscopic and HST+JWST photometric observations of 659 star-forming galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 9$ from DR3 of the JADES survey and the AURORA Cycle 1 program. We measure the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) for galaxies above $10^{8.5}\rm\ M_\odot$ where the sample is largely representative, estimating star-formation rates (SFRs) using the H$\alpha$ line flux and rest-frame far UV (1600\AA) continuum measurements, each independently corrected for dust attenuation. We find that the intrinsic, measurement-error-subtracted scatter in the SFMS ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) increases with decreasing stellar mass for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and we find no mass dependence of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ in the UV-based SFMS. Additionally, we find that $\sigma_{\rm int}$ decreases with increasing redshift, from $0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.22^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (H$\alpha$ SFMS), and from $0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ dex to $0.20^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ dex (UV SFMS) between $z\sim2$ and $z\sim 6.5$. We also measure the redshift evolution of the specific SFR and find that, assuming $\rm sSFR\propto (1+z)^\gamma$, $\gamma=1.89^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for the H$\alpha$-based SFMS, and $\gamma=1.36^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$ for the UV-based SFMS. Analyzing the observed H$\alpha$/UV luminosity ratios and star-formation histories from the {\sc prospector} fitting code, we find that 41--60\% of the sample is inconsistent with having a constant star-formation history. Finally, we find tentative evidence for shorter SFR burst timescales with increasing redshift based on the distribution of $\rm L_{H\alpha}/\nu L_{\nu,1600}$ vs. $\Delta\rm \log(L_{H\alpha})$. Taken together, these results are consistent with theoretical predictions of bursty star formation in the early Universe and provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of galaxy evolution.</div>

G4CMP, a Geant4-based extension for condensed matter physics, provides a comprehensive toolkit for modeling phonon and charge dynamics in cryogenic materials. This paper introduces a technical formalism to support the superconducting qubit and low-threshold detector community in implementing phonon simulations in custom materials into the G4CMP. As a case study, we present the results of a detailed analysis of silica phonon transport properties relevant for simulating substrate backgrounds in Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST)-style experiments using G4CMP.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other&#39;s thinking within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the usefulness and build on another model&#39;s partial thinking -- we call this off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can backtrack from &#34;distractions&#34; induced by misleading reasoning traces, and Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and reveals a counterintuitive finding -- &#34;stronger&#34; LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together, this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs.</div>

For massive galaxies, log(M) &gt; 9.5, our high resolution spectra of the rest optical range generally confirm the results of SED fitting, which relies primarily on excesses above the stellar emission between 1 and 6 microns to identify AGN. However, the method is undermined if the redshift used for the SED fitting is incorrect. Low mass galaxies, log(M) &lt; 9:5, can contain relatively warm dust that emits in the 4 - 6 micron range. We show that the potential contamination of AGN samples by purely star forming low-mass galaxies can be avoided by the use of the infrared properties of Haro 11 as a limiting star-forming SED template. However, relatively few star forming galaxies emit as strongly in the 3 - 6 micron range as this template, so this could result in missing some obscured AGNs to avoid a minor contamination. Including the behavior of the galaxies at rest lamda ~ 13.5 microns can mitigate this problem and yield more complete samples of bona fide AGN. JWST/MIRI supports this approach out to z ~ 0.6.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</div>

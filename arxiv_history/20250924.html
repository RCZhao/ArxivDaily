                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The source count dipole from wide-area radio continuum surveys allows us to test the cosmological standard model. Many radio sources have multiple components, which can cause an overdispersion of the source counts distribution. We account for this effect via a new Bayesian estimator, based on the negative binomial distribution. Combining the two best understood wide-area surveys, NVSS and RACS-low, and the deepest wide-area survey, LoTSS-DR2, we find that the source count dipole exceeds its expected value as the kinematic dipole amplitude from standard cosmology by a factor of $3.67 \pm 0.49$ -- a $5.4\sigma$ discrepancy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^itre Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The halo model, combined with halo occupation distribution (HOD) prescriptions, is widely used to interpret cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies and connect star-forming galaxies to large-scale structure. Recent implementations adopt more physical parameterizations, but it remains unclear whether these models reliably recover astrophysical quantities. We test whether current CIB halo models can constrain the star formation efficiency, $\eta(M_h,z)$, and the halo mass where it peaks, $M_{\rm max}$, when fitted to mock data. We examine whether discrepancies arise from emission assumptions (the HOD ingredients) or from more fundamental components, such as bias and matter clustering. Using the M21 CIB HOD model within the halo framework, we fit mock CIB power spectra and star formation rate density (SFRD) data from the SIDES-Uchuu simulation, then repeat the analysis with a simplified simulation (SSU) matched to the HOD assumptions. Comparing best-fit parameters to known inputs, we find that although the M21 model fits the mock data well, it fails to recover intrinsic parameters, especially $M_{\rm max}$, even when applied to data generated with consistent assumptions. Emission-related quantities (SFRD, emissivity) agree within 5%, but the two-halo term shows a redshift- and scale-dependent offset exceeding 20%, likely due to the linear treatment of halo bias and matter clustering. Scatter in the SFR-halo mass relation and spectral energy distributions significantly impacts shot noise ($\sim 50\%$) but only modestly ($&lt;10\%$) the clustered signal. We conclude that robust recovery of physical parameters from CIB clustering requires improved cosmological ingredients in halo models, including scale-dependent halo bias and nonlinear matter power spectra, alongside refined emission modeling.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide unique opportunities to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. In particular, the merger phase, during which two compact objects finally coalesce, corresponds to the regime of the strongest gravitational fields accessible by direct observation and thus serves as a probe of the nonlinear nature of gravity. In this work, we test GR in the merger phase by analyzing GW150914 using a modified waveform proposed in [Watarai et al. 2024], which parametrizes possible deviations from GR during this stage. Within this framework, the inferred deviation parameters can be translated into model-independent constraints on physically meaningful quantities. For GW150914, we find that the additional energy radiated in the merger phase is constrained to be $0.26^{+0.75}_{-0.62}~\%$ of the total energy emitted over the entire coalescence predicted by GR, and the deviation in the coalescence time is $2.17^{+9.56}_{-9.90}~\mathrm{ms}$, both within the $90\%$ credible interval. These two constraints serve as observational benchmarks for deviations in the nonlinear gravity regime, offering guidance for theoretical investigations of beyond-GR models.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The ringdown of a perturbed black hole consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), with complex frequencies determined by the black hole&#39;s mass and spin, while phases and amplitudes depend on binary parameters. Traditional semi-agnostic ringdown analyses ignore the remnant&#39;s binary-merger origin, assuming instead generic perturbations. This can lead to an unphysical number of free parameters and usage of priors inconsistent with those imposed by full inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) analysis. Here we revisit an alternative approach, first proposed in Calder\&#39;on Bustillo et al. 2021, in which ringdowns are modeled using the post-merger portion of full IMR waveform models. This naturally includes all QNMs without adding extra degrees of freedom and ties priors to binary parameters. We analyze the signal GW150914 with the post-merger portion of the IMR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, finding decisive evidence for the no-hair theorem with a Bayes factor $&gt;650:1$ or $&gt;99.8$% probability, compared to only $3:1$ from semi-agnostic spectroscopy, consistent with previous work. We also find modest evidence ($\simeq 5:1$) for the $(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)$ overtone and none for higher modes. Using simulated signals, we validate our formalism by showing accurate recovery of remnant properties. Next, by analysing simulated signals with post-merger signal-to-noise ratios up to 100, we show that classical spectroscopy based on overtone detection alone cannot provide strong no-hair tests. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-orthogonality of QNMs makes the inferred mode content strongly model-dependent, leading to multiple inconsistent interpretations that are equally well-supported by the data. We briefly discuss potential implications for recent events, such as GW231123 and GW250114.</div>

In this work, we investigate the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) effect induced by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field on the gravitational waveforms from the EMRI system. We observe that the LSB parameter $l$ appears in the leading order for the corrections of energy and angular momentum fluxes, and as $|l|$ increases, the differences in EMRI waveforms between the KR black hole and Schwarzschild black hole become more pronounced. We note that the LSB effect becomes detectable by LISA for values of $|l|\sim 10^{-6}$ with a one-year observation period. Furthermore, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approach for the parameter estimation and find the detection error for $l$ can be constrained to $\Delta l \sim 10^{-5}$ at $\mathrm{SNR} = 20$, demonstrating the potential of space-based gravitational wave detectors to rigorously test the KR field.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</div>

A Gaussian Monte-Carlo data enhancement method is adopted to enhance the meson data by considering the experimental errors, which significantly increase the data samples and improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. With the meson widths ranging from $\sim10^{-14}$ to 625 MeV, the relative errors of the predictions behave $0.07\%$, $1.0\%$, and $0.14\%$ in the training set, the test set, and all the data, respectively. The width predictions are presented for the currently discovered mesons and some theoretically predicted states. We also use the model as a probe to study the quantum numbers and inner structures for some undetermined states. Furthermore, this data-driven model is investigated to show well charge conjugation symmetry and approximate isospin symmetry, which is consistent with the physical phenomena. The results indicate that the deep neural network has powerful learning and inference abilities to describe and explore the hadron structures and the complicated interactions in particle physics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the origin and formation mechanisms of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba, we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place between $z \sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall) masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters. Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion (20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \leq 1$, with smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside). Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and 2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, we construct spherically symmetric solutions of Bardeen--boson stars within the framework of the Einstein--Klein--Gordon theory coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics by employing numerical methods. Considering a thin accretion disk in the equatorial plane as the light source, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of boson stars using the ray-tracing method and the stereographic projection technique. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the initial scalar field $\phi_0$, the magnetic charge $\mathcal{G}$, and the observation angle $\theta_o$, on the image structure. As compact horizonless objects, boson stars produce optical images dominated by direct emission, while their morphology undergoes significant distortions as $\theta_o$ increases. Higher values of $\phi_0$ and $\theta_o$ can give rise to lensing images. For all the parameters, the image center exhibits a brightness depression similar to the inner shadow of black holes, which poses challenges for distinguishing between boson stars and black holes. To address this, we propose two possible approaches: (i) combining the analysis of lensing bands with the effective potential to determine the existence of photon rings; and (ii) examining the polarization effects under synchrotron emission mechanisms. These results provide theoretical support for future high-resolution imaging efforts aimed at discriminating boson stars from black holes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy&#39;s distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $&lt;$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates&#39; positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores &gt; 97% on all FP scenarios and &gt; 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</div>

This work focuses on reducing the quantum noise, in the instrument&#39;s observation band of 0.1 to 10 Hz, by employing optical springs and a homodyne detection scheme. Although detuning 1000\,km long arm cavities was previously considered ineffective due to quantum state degradation from diffraction losses, we revisit this problem by formulating a new, rigorous model for quantum state of light by accounting for the vacuum state mixing as a result of diffraction losses. This work shows that high sensitivities can be achieved by employing optimal configurations of optical springs and homodyne detection schemes even with diffraction losses. These improvements alone are still not sufficient to achieve sensitivities to detect primordial gravitational waves as other technical noises limit further improvement.</div>

Recent work introduced decentralized random Fourier feature Gaussian processes (DRFGP), an online and distributed algorithm that casts GPs in an information-filter form, enabling exact sequential inference and fully distributed computation without reliance on a fusion center. In this paper, we extend DRFGP along two key directions: first, by introducing a robust-filtering update that downweights the impact of atypical observations; and second, by incorporating a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts to time-varying functions. The resulting algorithm retains the recursive information-filter structure while enhancing stability and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale Earth system application, underscoring its potential for in-situ modeling.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The pursuit of artificial general intelligence continuously demands generalization in one model across myriad tasks, even those not seen before. However, current AI models are isolated from each other for being limited to specific tasks, now first defined as Intelligence Islands. To unify Intelligence Islands into one, we propose Pangaea, the first AI supercontinent akin to the geological Pangaea. Pangaea encodes any data into a unified format and accumulates universal knowledge through pre-training on 296 datasets across diverse modalities. Eventually, it demonstrates remarkable generalization across 45 general tasks and 15 scientific tasks encompassing a wide range of scientific subjects. By investigating Pangaea deeper, the scaling effect of modality is revealed, quantifying the universal knowledge accumulation across modalities as the cumulative distribution function of a geometric distribution. On the whole, Pangaea shows strong potential to handle myriad tasks, indicating a new direction toward artificial general intelligence.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of three recently discovered star-forming dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino. The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They rank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach $\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf, allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star formation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar population of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this mass regime ($M_V=-10.62\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo, $M_V=-10.91\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and $M_V=-12.02\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our HST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino show relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed $\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago. These results align with theoretical predictions of diverse evolutionary pathways for isolated low-mass galaxies.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Conditional multidimensional scaling seeks for a low-dimensional configuration from pairwise dissimilarities, in the presence of other known features. By taking advantage of available data of the known features, conditional multidimensional scaling improves the estimation quality of the low-dimensional configuration and simplifies knowledge discovery tasks. However, existing conditional multidimensional scaling methods require full data of the known features, which may not be always attainable due to time, cost, and other constraints. This paper proposes a conditional multidimensional scaling method that can learn the low-dimensional configuration when there are missing values in the known features. The method can also impute the missing values, which provides additional insights of the problem. Computer codes of this method are maintained in the cml R package on CRAN.</div>

By integrating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a specially tailored matter source that models quantum particle creation, we derive novel, non-singular black hole solutions. These black holes exhibit rich horizon structures and, notably, do not undergo complete evaporation -- instead, they stabilize into permanent remnants. In addition to analyzing the thermodynamic implications of quantum corrections to Dymnikova-Schwinger black holes, we examine their quasinormal mode spectra using the WKB approximation, alongside their associated energy emission rates. Our findings provide compelling new perspectives on how quantum effects may address foundational issues such as the black hole information loss paradox.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~&gt;2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background. In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A galaxy&#39;s mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy&#39;s activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7 {\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.</div>

The fundamental point of disagreement is whether or not the likelihood function exists in a part of parameter space where the statistical model does not exist. (The new paper says yes; FC say no.)

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.</div>

While galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments. Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have experienced group processing, with only $\sim$20\% remaining centrals throughout their life. For $\rm 9 10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even at fixed mass. The most massive $\rm \log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) &gt; 11$) galaxies accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.</div>

When multiple ML models are trained using the same training points, their model uncertainties may be statistically dependent. In reality, model inputs are also random with input uncertainty.

This study develops a theoretical framework that generates the joint distribution of multiple ML predictions given the joint distribution of model uncertainties and the joint distribution of model inputs. The strategy is to decouple the coupling between the two types of uncertainty and transform them as independent random variables.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper investigates a new black hole solution within the framework of bumblebee gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections parameterized by $\Theta$ and implemented through the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$. Notably, the event horizon remains unaffected by $\Theta$, while the surface gravity becomes ill-defined, in agreement with the behavior previously reported for the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole [1]. The propagation of light is examined by analyzing null geodesics, identifying critical orbits, and determining the resulting black hole shadow. To complement these analyses, we explore gravitational lensing by evaluating the deflection angle in both the weak- and strong-field regimes. Using these results, constraints are derived for the lensing observables by comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, we close the analysis by deriving additional constraints from standard Solar System experiments, including Mercury&#39;s orbital precession, gravitational light bending, and time-delay measurements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gradient boosting has become a cornerstone of machine learning, enabling base learners such as decision trees to achieve exceptional predictive performance. While existing algorithms primarily handle scalar or Euclidean outputs, increasingly prevalent complex-structured data, such as distributions, networks, and manifold-valued outputs, present challenges for traditional methods. Such non-Euclidean data lack algebraic structures such as addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication required by standard gradient boosting frameworks. To address these challenges, we introduce Fr\&#39;echet geodesic boosting (FGBoost), a novel approach tailored for outputs residing in geodesic metric spaces. FGBoost leverages geodesics as proxies for residuals and constructs ensembles in a way that respects the intrinsic geometry of the output space. Through theoretical analysis, extensive simulations, and real-world applications, we demonstrate the strong performance and adaptability of FGBoost, showcasing its potential for modeling complex data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Whitening is a classical technique in unsupervised learning that can facilitate estimation tasks by standardizing data. An important application is the estimation of latent variable models via the decomposition of tensors built from high-order moments. In particular, whitening orthogonalizes the means of a spherical Gaussian mixture model (GMM), thereby making the corresponding moment tensor orthogonally decomposable, hence easier to decompose. However, in the large-dimensional regime (LDR) where data are high-dimensional and scarce, the standard whitening matrix built from the sample covariance becomes ineffective because the latter is spectrally distorted. Consequently, whitened means of a spherical GMM are no longer orthogonal. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact limits for their dot products, which are generally nonzero in the LDR. As our main contribution, we then construct a corrected whitening matrix that restores asymptotic orthogonality, allowing for performance gains in spherical GMM estimation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper proposes a numerical method using neural networks to solve the path integral problem in quantum mechanics for arbitrary potentials. The method is based on a radial basis function expansion of the interaction term that appears in the Euclidean path integral formalism. By constructing a corresponding multi-layered perceptron-type neural network with exponential nonlinearities in the hidden layer, the original path integral can be approximated by a linear combination of Gaussian path integrals that can be solved analytically. The method has been tested for the double-well potential that includes a quadratic and a quartic term, giving very good, within a few percent agreement between the true and estimated bound state wave functions that are extracted from the propagator at large Euclidean times. The proposed method can also be used to describe potentials that have imaginary parts, which is tested for a simple Gaussian path integral with complex frequencies, where the model uncertainty stays below one percent for both the real and imaginary parts of the propagator.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed&#39;&#39; exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed&#39;&#39; fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Asteroid families are typically identified using hierarchical clustering methods (HCM) in the proper element phase space. However, these methods struggle with overlapping families, interlopers, and the detection of older structures. Spectroscopic data can help overcome these limitations. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. Using Gaia spectroscopic data, we investigate a region in the central Main Belt centered around 2.72 AU, known for its connection to L- type asteroids. Conflicting family memberships reported by different HCM implementations underscore the need for an independent dynamical analysis of this region. We determine family memberships by applying a color taxonomy derived from Gaia data and by assessing the spectral similarity between candidate members and the template spectrum of each family. We identify an L- type asteroid family in the central Main Belt, with (460) Scania as its largest member. Analysis of the family&#39;s V-shape indicates that it is relatively old, with an estimated age of approximately 1 Gyr, which likely explains its non detection by the HCM. The family&#39;s existence is supported by statistical validation, and its distribution in proper element space is well reproduced by numerical simulations. Independent evidence from taxonomy, polarimetry, and spin-axis obliquities consistently supports the existence of this L- type family. This work highlights the value of combining dynamical and physical data to characterize asteroid families and raises questions about the origin of L- type families, potentially linked to primordial objects retaining early protoplanetary disk properties. Further spectroscopic data are needed to clarify these families.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities not only in language generation but also in advancing scientific discovery. A growing body of work has explored ways to improve their reasoning, from self-consistency and chain-of-thought to multi-agent debate. Inspired by the dynamics of scientific committees and the &#34;Society of Mind,&#34; we introduce Roundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that performs inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in complex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in terms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing hallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes structured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while requiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly applicable to multi-LLM reasoning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding the formation and evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies is a fundamental goal of cosmology, using various tracers of the cosmic large-scale structure at an ever wider range of redshifts. Our principal aim is to advance the mapping of the cosmic web at high redshifts using observational and synthetic catalogues of quasars (QSOs), which offer a powerful probe of structure formation and the validity of the concordance cosmological model. In this analysis, we selected 708,483 QSOs at $0.8&lt;z&lt;2.2$ from the Quaia data set, allowing a reconstruction of the matter density field using 24,372 deg$^2$ sky area with a well-understood selection function, and thus going beyond previous studies. Using the REVOLVER method, we created catalogues of voids and clusters based on the estimation of the local density at QSO positions with Voronoi tessellation. We tested the consistency of Quaia data and 50 mock catalogues, including various parameters of the voids and clusters in data subsets, and also measurements of the density profiles of these cosmic super-structures at $100 h^{-1}$Mpc scales. We identified 12,842 voids and 41,111 clusters in the distribution of Quaia QSOs. The agreement between data and mocks is at a level of 5-10%, considering void and cluster radii, average inner density, and density profiles. In particular, we tested the role of survey mask proximity effects in the void and cluster detection, which albeit present, are consistent in simulations and observations. The largest voids and clusters reach $R_{eff} \approx 250 h^{-1}$Mpc and $150 h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively, but without evidence for ultra-large cosmic structures exceeding the dimensions of the largest structures in the mocks. As an important deliverable, we share our density field estimation, void catalogues, and cluster catalogues with the public, allowing various additional cross-correlation probes at high-z.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass range [600 - 24000] $M_{\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$) and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\sim$ 5000 $M_{\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses below 6000 $M_{\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the $C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxies with high star-formation rate surface densities often host large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.</div>

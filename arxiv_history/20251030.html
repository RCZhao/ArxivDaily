                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The direct, empirical determination of the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) has markedly advanced thanks to improved instrumentation, measurement techniques, and distance estimators. However, combining determinations from different estimators is non-trivial, due to correlated calibrations and different analysis methodologies. Using covariance weighting and leveraging the broad and comprehensive community of experts, we constructed a rigorous and transparent Distance Network (DN) to find a consensus value and uncertainty for the local H0. All critically reviewed the available data sets, spanning parallaxes, detached eclipsing binaries, masers, Cepheids, the TRGB, Miras, JAGB stars, SN Ia, Surface Brightness Fluctuations, SN II, the Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations and voted for indicators to define a `baseline&#39; DN and others to assess robustness and sensitivity of the results. We provide open-source software and data products to support full transparency and future extensions of this effort. Our conclusions: 1) Local H0 is robustly determined, with first-rank indicators internally consistent within their uncertainties; 2) A covariance-weighted combination yields an uncertainty of 1.1% (baseline) or 0.9% (all estimators); 3) The contribution from SNe Ia is consistent across four current compilations of optical magnitudes or using NIR-only magnitudes; 4) Removing either Cepheids or TRGB has minimal effect; 5) Replacing SNe Ia with galaxy-based indicators changes H0 by less than 0.1 km/s/Mpc, while doubling its uncertainty; 6) The baseline result is H0=73.50+/-0.81 km/s/Mpc. Compared to early Universe results, our result differs by 7.1sigma from flat {\Lambda}CDM with Planck+SPT+ACT and 5.0 sigma with BBN+BAO (DESI2). A networked approach is invaluable for enabling further progress in accuracy and precision without overreliance on any single method, sample or group.</div>

The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a systematic comparison of three independent machine learning (ML)-based searches for strong gravitational lenses applied to the Dark Energy Survey (Jacobs et al. 2019a,b; Rojas et al. 2022; Gonzalez et al. 2025). Each search employs a distinct ML architecture and training strategy, allowing us to evaluate their relative performance, completeness, and complementarity. Using a visually inspected sample of 1651 systems previously reported as lens candidates, we assess how each model scores these systems and quantify their agreement with expert classifications. The three models show progressive improvement in performance, with F1-scores of 0.31, 0.35, and 0.54 for Jacobs, Rojas, and Gonzalez, respectively. Their completeness for moderate- to high-confidence lens candidates follows a similar trend (31%, 52%, and 70%). When combined, the models recover 82% of all such systems, highlighting their strong complementarity. Additionally, we explore ensemble strategies: average, median, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and an Independent Bayesian method. We find that all but averaging achieve higher maximum F1 scores than the best individual model, with some ensemble methods improving precision by up to a factor of six. These results demonstrate that combining multiple, diverse ML classifiers can substantially improve the completeness of lens samples while drastically reducing false positives, offering practical guidance for optimizing future ML-based strong lens searches in wide-field surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Variational mean field approximations tend to struggle with contemporary overparametrized deep neural networks. Where a Bayesian treatment is usually associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power, and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound (ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of reparametrizations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The cosmic dipole anomaly -- the observation of a significant mismatch between the dipole observed in the matter distribution and that expected given the kinematic interpretation of the cosmic microwave background dipole -- poses a serious challenge to the Cosmological Principle upon which the standard model of cosmology rests. Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell &gt; 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6~million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole&#39;s proportion to be marginal. Our results therefore reaffirm the anomalously high dipole in the distribution of quasars.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The South Pole Telescope (SPT), using its third-generation camera, SPT-3G, is conducting observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in temperature and polarization across approximately 10 000 deg$^2$ of the sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ &lt; 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (&lt; 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 200 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data. The likelihood pipeline developed and used in this work is made publicly available online.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for nearly 10,000 galaxies. Unlike previous studies that relied on filament orientations, we directly utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide the most direct empirical evidence to date for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</div>

Our method leverages a flow-based approach to learn the likelihood transport from one simulator to the other. Since multiple transport maps exist, we employ Conditional Optimal Transport Flow Matching (COT-FM) to ensure that the transformation minimally distorts the underlying structure of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by bridging weak lensing simulators: a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) to a N-body Particle-Mesh (PM). We demonstrate that our emulator captures the full correction between the simulators by showing that it enables full-field inference to accurately recover the true posterior, validating its accuracy beyond traditional summary statistics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The existence of black hole shadows is one of the most interesting effects of the strong field regime of general relativity (GR). Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided high-resolution images of the vicinity of supermassive black holes, ushering in a new era for testing gravitation on astrophysical scales. In this work, we continue the investigation initiated by \cite{furtado2025gravitational}, focusing on shadows associated with generalized $k-n$ \emph{black-bounce} type spacetimes, which smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We consider a generalization of the metric with free parameters $(a,k,n)$ that modify the mass function and enrich the possible phenomenology. We develop a semi-analytical study of photon orbits, obtaining the critical impact parameter and the shadow radius for different parameter combinations. Subsequently, we perform numerical ray-tracing simulations using the \textsc{GYOTO} code, incorporating optically thick accretion disks and varying the observation angle. Our results reveal characteristic signatures, including the formation of double-ring structures and deformations of the shadow radius, which can serve as observational discriminators between classical black holes and \emph{black-bounce} solutions.</div>

These results from nearby groups and clusters are placed into context with integral-field spectroscopic surveys of galaxies, which allow the co-spatial measurement of PN and stellar population properties. I provide an outlook on upcoming instrumentation that will provide new opportunities for the study of extragalactic PN populations.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging its warm-up period. We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning, we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques, including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic systems.</div>

We use MUSE integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) data for 212 ETGs at intermediate redshift ($0.25 11.3$).

Furthermore, we show that the same parameter space predicts observable stochastic gravitational waves within the sensitivities of future space-based detectors, as well as a sizable deviation in the Higgs triple coupling that can be probed at future lepton colliders.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</div>

Previous research developed the OmniLearn foundation model for jet physics, using unique properties of particle physics, and showed that it could significantly advance discovery potential across collider experiments. This paper introduces a major upgrade, resulting in the OmniLearned framework. This framework has three new elements: (1) updates to the model architecture and training, (2) using over one billion jets used for training, and (3) providing well-documented software for accessing all datasets and models. We demonstrate OmniLearned with three representative tasks: top-quark jet tagging with the community Delphes-based benchmark dataset, b-tagging with ATLAS full simulation, and anomaly detection with CMS experimental data. In each case, OmniLearned is the state of the art, further expanding the discovery potential of past, current, and future collider experiments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present high-resolution ($\sim$50$-$100 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) or $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission in seven local ($z$ $\lesssim$ 0.05) major mergers -- five of which are dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) systems, and two of which are single AGN systems. We model the molecular gas kinematics through rotating disk profiles using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The residuals were then used to isolate non-rotating components of the molecular gas -- the most likely contributor to future SMBH growth. We find that more massive SMBHs have higher surface densities of non-rotating molecular gas within their sphere of influence. This potential molecular gas supply, however, does not correlate with the current accretion efficiency of the SMBHs, suggesting that only a fraction of the observed non-rotating gas is currently reaching the SMBH. Finally, we tentatively find no significant differences in the nuclear molecular gas masses of single AGN and dual AGN hosts, both within the SMBH sphere of influence and within the central kiloparsec. Our results indicate that the probability of occurrence of the dual AGN phenomenon is likely dependent on AGN variability and/or obscuration rather than the availability of molecular gas in the nuclear regions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate geodesic motion and gravitational-wave signatures of charged black holes with scalar hair. Using the effective potential approach, we analyze marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, showing how their positions and energy thresholds are modified by the scalar hair parameter $r_B$. These results demonstrate scalar hair&#39;s role in altering the boundary of stable motion. We further explore periodic orbits characterized by rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index $(z,w,v)$, and quantify how scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these orbital properties, we compute gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generate waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly affected by $r_B$.

Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and observational reconstruction in the SKA era.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in planning. Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations. First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset planning guidance. Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D) paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization during inference to maximize planning performance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors, such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.</div>

This analysis is conducted within a larger study to identify long-period variable (LPV) stars in these galaxies. The survey was performed with the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5-m INT and covers multiple epochs obtained between 2015 and 2018 in the i (Sloan) and V (Harris) bands. To determine the half-light radii, we derived surface brightness and number density profiles for each system and fitted them with Exponential, Plummer, and S\&#39;ersic models. The resulting half-light radii are in good agreement with literature values but reveal subtle variations linked to differences in stellar distribution and morphology. Distances were independently estimated using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, yielding values consistent with previous determinations.

Within the framework of extended BZ monopole expansion, we have studied BZ process in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld BH spacetime and analyzed effects of the tidal charge on the energy and angular momentum extraction rates. It is found that the positive tidal charge reduces the BZ power of a braneworld BH, while the negative tidal charge enhances the power. Compared with a Kerr BH of the same mass and angular velocity, the BZ power exhibits a maximum reduction of approximately $15.2\%$ in positive cases, whereas in negative cases, it achieves a maximum enhancement of $66.5\%$ in power output. A similar qualitative trend is also observed for the relative angular momentum extraction rate, albeit with different magnitudes.</div>

In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. Here, in Paper I, we develop the spatial geometries of multiple galaxy/CGM structures and populate these structures with 3D velocity fields. For arbitrary viewing angles and galaxy-quasar impact parameters, we derive observer coordinate-based expressions for the perceived azimuthal angle and galaxy inclination and a generalized scalar expression for the line-of-sight velocity as a function of position along the line of sight. We motivate and develop four idealized galaxy/CGM spatial-kinematic structures based on empirical data and theoretical predictions: (1) a rotating galactic disk/extra-planar gas, (2) a static or dynamic spherical halo, (3) an outflowing bi-polar galactic wind, and (4) an inward spiraling flared planar accretion. Using a small set of free parameters, the spatial geometries and velocity fields can be adjusted and explored, including velocity gradients, wind stalling, and accretion trajectories. These spatial-kinematic models are designed to be flexible and easily modified and can be tailored for studying individual galaxy-absorber pairs or galaxy group environments; they can be applied to real-world observations or hydrodynamic simulations of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems. These models also serve as tools for developing physical intuition. In Paper II, we will present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating absorption profiles for ions of interest.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this two-paper series, we present a straightforward mathematical model for synthesizing quasar absorption line profiles from sight lines through idealized, spatial-kinematic models of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and their host galaxies. In Paper I, we developed the spatial components of the galaxy/CGM structures (disk, halo, wind, accretion) and their 3D velocity fields. We derived the formalism for arbitrary observed orientation of the galaxy/CGM model and quasar line of sight positioning. In this paper, following a brief review of Paper I, we present the formalism for populating the galaxy/CGM structures with multiphase photoionized and collisionally ionized gas and for generating HI and metal-line absorption profiles. Example absorption line systems through a fiducial galaxy/CGM model are presented. These flexible spatial-kinematic absorption models (SKAMs) can be directly applied to and/or easily modified/expanded for studying individual or ensembles of observed absorption line systems, for exploring various competing theoretical scenarios of the baryon cycle as studied through quasar absorption line systems, and/or serving as pedagogical tools for developing physical intuition. We briefly describe a SKAM GUI that is in early stages of development.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO&#39;s large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</div>

Potential contributing sources to such a background include compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this work, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave energy emitted by CCSNe using cross-correlation measurements made with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors during their third observing run (O3). Specifically, we obtain a $95\%$ credibility upper limit of $0.01~ {M_\odot c^2}$ while accounting for the contribution from CBC sources to a GWB. This result improves on previous constraint obtained from initial LIGO data by approximately two orders of magnitude. We also explore the detection prospects of third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer for both individual CCSNe events and the GWB. Our results show that single events are likely to be detected prior to the GWB.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where &#34;decision-first, observation-later&#34; mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model&#39;s &#34;specialisation&#34; towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Quasar absorption systems not only affect the way quasars are selected, but also serve as key probes of galaxies, providing insight into their chemical evolution and interstellar medium (ISM). Recently, a method based on Gaia astrometric measurements has aided the selection of quasars reddened by dust hitherto overlooked. We conducted a spectroscopic study using VLT/X-Shooter on one such dust-reddened quasar, Q2310-3358. This quasar, at $z = 2.3908\pm0.0003$, is associated with a Damped Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) at nearly the same redshift $2.4007\pm0.0003$, with a neutral hydrogen column density of $\log N(\mathrm{H\,I}) = 21.214 \pm 0.003$. The DLA is very metal-rich (close to the Solar metallicity after correction for depletion on dust grains). Its properties align with the metal-to-dust ratio and the mass-metallicity relation established in previous large samples of DLAs. Surprisingly, given its proximity to the quasar in redshift, the absorber has strong cold gas characteristics, including CI and H$_2$. Based on the derived kinetic temperature of $71^{+28}_{-15}$~K, we infer the presence of a strong UV radiation field, which in turn suggests that the quasar and the DLA are in close proximity, i.e. part of the same galaxy and not just different objects in the same overdensity of galaxies. We use the line ratios of the CI fine-structure lines to constrain the density of the cold gas, yielding $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Our analysis extends the understanding of $z_{abs} \approx z_{em}$ absorption line systems and provides valuable constraints on the interplay between dust, metals, and neutral gas in the ISM of early galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model&#39;s agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model&#39;s downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have become a principal tool for goodness-of-fit testing, but standard KSDs are often insensitive to higher-order dependency structures, such as tail dependence, which are critical in many scientific and financial domains. We address this gap by introducing the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence, rather than relying on the joint density&#39;s score function. For the broad class of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of $O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear $\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for dependence-aware inference.</div>

We derive the linear kernel, and utilize the Feynman path integral time evolution to show that Airy function wave packets are non-dispersive in free space. We then model the confining contribution to 1S - 2S heavy meson mass gaps as a 1+1D absolute linear potential and look at the correspondence of the Airy function zeros. In doing so, we predicted the confining contribution to the mass gap of heavy mesons with a good accuracy when compared to calculations performed in the light front. Furthermore, we used these Airy function solutions to model the quantum states of a neutron under Earth&#39;s gravity. We show that the measured heights of a neutron can be modeled by the zeros of the Airy function, and compare to experimental data and predictions utilizing the WKB approximation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Several experimental analyses have reported mild excesses near 95 GeV that could indicate the presence of a light Higgs-like scalar. We study the phenomenology of such a state within the flipped Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM-F) at the proposed Circular Electron--Positron Collider (CEPC). The light scalar $S$ is investigated through the Higgsstrahlung process $e^+e^- \to Z(\mu^+\mu^-)S$ with $S\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and $S\to b \bar{b}$ decay modes. A full Monte Carlo simulation including detector effects is performed to estimate the discovery reach and precision measurement potential. To maximize the sensitivity, we employ particle-level transformer networks (ParT and MIParT) that exploit correlations among all reconstructed objects. Compared with a cut-based baseline, improves the expected measurement precision by a factor of 2.4 in the $\tau\tau$ channel and 1.4 in the $b b$ channel. For viable benchmark points in the N2HDM-F, the attainable precisions on the signal rate reach 1.0% and 0.63%, respectively. Interpreted in a model-independent framework, the CEPC can achieve a 5$\sigma$ discovery for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;1.6\times10^{-2}$ and $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;4.2\times10^{-3}$, and reach a 1% precision for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;0.96$ and $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;0.13$. These results highlight the potential of particle-level machine learning techniques in extending the light-Higgs exploration program at future lepton colliders.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Score-based generative models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) achieve impressive performance in sampling from unknown distributions, but often fail to satisfy underlying constraints. We propose a constrained generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models based on reflected diffusion with local time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks, regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models, large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not &#34;identical twins&#34;. The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the brain.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The present work introduces curvature-based rejection sampling (CURS). This is a method for sampling from a general class of probability densities defined on Riemannian manifolds. It can be used to sample from any probability density which ``depends only on distance&#34;. The idea is to combine the statistical principle of rejection sampling with the geometric principle of volume comparison. CURS is an exact sampling method and (assuming the underlying Riemannian manifold satisfies certain technical conditions) it has a particularly moderate computational cost. The aim of the present work is to show that there are many applications where CURS should be the user&#39;s method of choice for dealing with relatively low-dimensional scenarios.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.</div>

The recent hint from the ACT results pushes the scalar spectral index closer to the scale-invariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, calling for a theoretical paradigm shift towards a Harrison-Zeldovich attractor, which is difficult to realize in the standard single-field slow-roll inflationary scenario. In this Letter, we achieve the Harrison-Zeldovich attractor scenario via nonminimal derivative coupling, attracting the monomial inflation, hilltop inflation, and $\alpha$-attractor E-model towards the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.</div>

Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods. We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel&#39;dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system; see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017), arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $ 10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ &gt;0.8 $ and with a reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these estimates almost by an order of magnitude.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe&#39;s evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential&#39;. Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.</div>

It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Universe and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. In this work we investigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and $\zeta$, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of $\zeta$ and derive the PBH formation fraction $\beta$ without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of $\beta$ to the curvaton decay fraction $\Omega_{\chi,\rm dec}$. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this study, we examine over 14,000 radio galaxies finely selected from Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) project and provide classifications for approximately 5,900 FRIs and 8,100 FRIIs. We present an analysis of these predicted radio galaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio galaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between morphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we find that the model&#39;s confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap region, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the presence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect to the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a comparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those identified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their selection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We investigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on model performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while different pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear to cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and observational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that the same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning. As automated approaches to astronomical source identification and classification become increasingly prevalent, we highlight training data choices that can affect the model outputs and propagate into downstream analyses.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose the Entropic-regularized Robust Optimal Transport (E-ROBOT) framework, a novel method that combines the robustness of ROBOT with the computational and statistical benefits of entropic regularization. We show that, rooted in the Schr\&#34;{o}dinger bridge problem theory, E-ROBOT defines the robust Sinkhorn divergence $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$, where the parameter $\lambda$ controls robustness and $\varepsilon$ governs the regularization strength. Letting $n\in \mathbb{N}$ denote the sample size, a central theoretical contribution is establishing that the sample complexity of $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$ is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality that plagues standard ROBOT. This dimension-free property unlocks the use of $\overline{W}_{\varepsilon,\lambda}$ as a loss function in large-dimensional statistical and machine learning tasks. With this regard, we demonstrate its utility through four applications: goodness-of-fit testing; computation of barycenters for corrupted 2D and 3D shapes; definition of gradient flows; and image colour transfer. From the computation standpoint, a perk of our novel method is that it can be easily implemented by modifying existing (\texttt{Python}) routines. From the theoretical standpoint, our work opens the door to many research directions in statistics and machine learning: we discuss some of them.</div>

Accurate representation of uncertainties and detailed experimental covariance matrices, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties, are essential for high-quality extractions. This paper explores instrumental and analytical contributions to fit and model uncertainties, along with methods for integrating these uncertainties into quantifiable results, ensuring robust extraction of physical observables across local and global datasets. Using pseudodata we demonstrate the critical role of accurate uncertainty propagation in producing meaningful results and advancing our understanding of partonic structure and dynamics inside of hardrons. \keywords{Deep neural networks \and Hadronic Physics \and Transverse momentum dependent parton distributions functions \and Compton form factors \and Uncertainty Analysis</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) using semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten targeted searches over a 10 day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky searches over a 1 day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases. The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of $p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %) and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard architecture and minimal tuning.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA&#39;s top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.</div>

Our analysis is based on data from the BELLE collaboration. We improve on previous determinations in several key aspects: we employ state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO); we limit the use of Monte Carlo event generators to estimating the relative contributions of different flavors, a necessary input due to the limited flavor sensitivity of the available data; and, in addition to a traditional fit based on a physics-informed functional form, we explore a Neural Network parametrization. This latter approach paves the way for more robust and flexible determinations of Dihadron Fragmentation Functions using machine learning techniques.</div>

This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.</div>

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy clusters are among the largest and densest structures in the Universe. Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, and [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\star$) and the 4000 \r{A} break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\star-\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster&#39;s total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a &#39;delayed-then-rapid&#39; quenching scenario.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper presents a novel anisotropic quark star model in the backdrop of mimetic gravitational theory. Our study focuses on the strange quark stars using the MIT bag equation of state (EoS) admitting non-singular Buchdahl metric function. The proposed model matches the interior spacetime of the strange quark star with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Our analysis of the energy conditions, radial and tangential EoSs along with the energy momentum tensor gradients and TOV equilibrium condition analysis support the model&#39;s physical validity. Further study of adiabatic index, surface redshift function and speed of sound analysis have demonstrated the stability of the strange quark star in mimetic gravity. Thus, we can say that the model stability and consistency have been validated for various parameter values of the Buchdahl function throughout our study in the context of mimetic gravity.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce FANG (Focused Angular $n$-body event Generator), a new Monte Carlo tool for efficient event generation in restricted Lorentz-invariant phase space (LIPS). Unlike conventional approaches that uniformly sample the full $4\pi$ solid angle, FANG directly generates events in which selected final-state particles are constrained to fixed directions or finite angular regions in the laboratory frame. Because of the way the generator is constructed, angular constraints can be imposed directly in the laboratory frame while maintaining the correct LIPS structure, enabling differential and total cross sections or decay rates to be computed with high efficiency. The method is validated against analytic results and existing event generators, showing excellent agreement. By reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude for angular observables, FANG provides a robust and versatile framework for applications in particle, nuclear, and detector physics.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe&#39;s expansion and Zwicky&#39;s tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (&#34;wandering&#34;) BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Horton-Strahler number (HS) is a measure of branching complexity of rooted trees, introduced in hydrology and later studied in parallel computing under the name register function. While its order of growth is well understood for classical random trees, fluctuation behavior has largely resisted analysis. In this work we investigate the HS in the setting of butterfly trees -- binary trees constructed from butterfly permutations, a rich class of separable permutations with origins in numerical linear algebra and parallel architectures. For the subclass of simple butterfly trees, we exploit their recursive gluing structure to model the HS as an additive functional of a finite-state Markov process. This framework yields sharp distributional results, including a law of large numbers and a Central Limit Theorem with explicit variance growth, providing what appears to be the first genuine Gaussian limit law for the HS in a nontrivial random tree model. Extending to biased constructions, we further establish functional limit theorems via analytic and probabilistic tools. For general butterfly trees, while exact analysis remains open, empirical sampling shows that the HS distribution is confined to a narrower support than in classical models, and appears to concentrate tightly near the upper bound $\lfloor \log_4 N\rfloor$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto&#39;s approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury&#39;s orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31&#39;s halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through the dark matter (DM) spikes of active galactic nuclei entails significant energy loss via interactions with DM. While previous studies of sub-GeV DM have focused on elastic scattering, this process becomes insufficient at higher proton energies and DM masses. In this work, we investigate the CR-DM deep inelastic scattering (DIS) as mediated by a vector portal. We calculate the DIS contribution to the CR energy loss rate and derive stringent exclusion limits on the CR-DM scattering cross-section for DM masses between $10^{-6}$ GeV and $1$ GeV. For higher CR energies and mediator masses, the resulting CR cooling timescales are reduced by orders of magnitude after involving the DIS contribution, producing stringent constraints that surpass most of current experimental limits.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This article deals with the problem of testing conditional independence between two random vectors ${\bf X}$ and ${\bf Y}$ given a confounding random vector ${\bf Z}$. Several authors have considered this problem for multivariate data. However, most of the existing tests has poor performance against local contiguous alternatives beyond linear dependency. In this article, an Energy distance type measure of conditional dependence is developed, borrowing ideas from the model-X framework. A consistent estimator of the measure is proposed, and its theoretical properties are studied under general assumptions. Using the estimator as a test statistic a test of conditional independence is developed, and a suitable resampling algorithm is designed to calibrate the test. The test turns out to be not only large sample consistent, but also Pitman efficient against local contiguous alternatives, and is provably consistent when the dimension of the data diverges to infinity with the sample size. Several empirical studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the test against state-of-the-art methods.</div>

We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2&lt;1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Although conceptually related, variable selection and relative importance (RI) analysis have been treated quite differently in the literature. While RI is typically used for post-hoc model explanation, this paper explores its potential for variable ranking and filter-based selection before model creation. Specifically, we anticipate strong performance from the RI measures because they incorporate both direct and combined effects of predictors, addressing a key limitation of marginal correlation that ignores dependencies among predictors. We implement and evaluate the RI-based variable selection methods using general dominance (GD), comprehensive relative importance (CRI), and a newly proposed, computationally efficient variant termed CRI.Z. We first demonstrate how the RI measures more accurately rank the variables than the marginal correlation, especially when there are suppressed or weak predictors. We then show that predictive models built on these rankings are highly competitive, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as the lasso and relaxed lasso. The proposed RI-based methods are particularly effective in challenging cases involving clusters of highly correlated predictors, a setting known to cause failures in many benchmark methods. Although lasso methods have dominated the recent literature on variable selection, our study reveals that the RI-based method is a powerful and competitive alternative. We believe these underutilized tools deserve greater attention in statistics and machine learning communities.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing for modeling dynamical systems from time series data. Our approach uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded input, allowing an arbitrary dimension of the feature space, thus providing a flexible alternative to the polynomial-based projections used in previous next-generation reservoir computing variants. We apply the method to benchmark tasks -- including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation -- using only partial and noisy observations. We also include an exploratory example of estimating asymptotic oscillation phases. The models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond training data. This framework enables the precise control of system state and is well suited for surrogate modeling and digital twin applications.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we study a self-dual black hole (BH) in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. Using observational data from Mercury&#39;s perihelion shift and the orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A$^{\star}$ (Sgr A$^{\star}$), we derive constraints on the polymeric function $P$. We further investigate photon trajectories near the self-dual BH under various scenarios to explore their observational relevance. Finally, we examine the properties of accretion disks around the self-dual BH in LQG, including their direct and secondary images, and study the redshift and the observed energy flux distribution across the accretion disk as measured by distant observers for different inclination angles. Our findings provide new insights into the physical nature and accretion properties of self-dual BHs in LQG and their possible observational consequences.</div>

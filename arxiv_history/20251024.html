                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The sound horizon scale $r_s$ is a key source of information for early-time $H_0$ measurements, and is therefore a common target of new physics proposed to solve the Hubble tension. We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power -- up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.761\pm 0.045$ and $S_8 = 0.794\pm 0.040$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k &gt; \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things&#39;&#39; (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We explore the Hubble tension within an anisotropic cosmological framework by revisiting the Bianchi type-I model introduced in Le Delliou et al. 2020. Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.</div>

Using the CAMELS multifield dataset, we are able to condition our mapping on both cosmological and astrophysical properties. We focus this work on hydrodynamical quantities suitable for Lya observables finding excellent agreement up to small spatial scales, k ~ 10.0 (h^(-1) Mpc) at z=2.0, for Lya flux statistics. Our approach is fully convolutional, allowing training on comparatively small volumes and application to larger volumes, which was tested on TNG50.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled &#39;in silico&#39; environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.</div>

This structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization. Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth, (b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}} \left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT, and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks, visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories. Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo&#39;s effectiveness on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient. Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be truncated to fit inference constraints.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</div>

Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.</div>

The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy) that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust framework for preference-based alignment.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language, sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules. RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.</div>

We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">All simulation approaches eventually face limits in computational scalability when applied to large spatiotemporal domains. This challenge becomes especially apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next- generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z \sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar, AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population- inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge across cosmic history.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Launching in 2027 and 2029, respectively, Twinkle and Ariel will conduct the first large-scale homogeneous spectroscopic surveys of the atmospheres of hundreds of diverse exoplanets. This will fundamentally transition the field to an era of population-level characterisation. In this pilot study, we aim to explore possible synergies between Twinkle and Ariel to determine for instance whether prior Twinkle observations can substantially inform the target selection and observing strategy of Ariel. This study primarily aims to encourage further investigation by both consortium communities by showing what a potential scientific synergy would look like on a promising scientific case that requires further exploration. For this aim, we select a small subset of &#34;cool&#34; planets that are also particularly well-suited to be observed by Twinkle and therefore Ariel. By using representative noise estimates for both missions, we compute the number of visits required for an observation. Then, we simulate and retrieve transmission spectra of each target, assuming gaseous, H2/He-dominated atmospheres and various atmospheric models. For all candidates, we find that atmospheric parameters are generally retrieved well within 1-sigma to input values, with Ariel typically achieving tighter constraints. We demonstrate that for a small subset of cool gaseous planets, exploitable synergies exist between Twinkle and Ariel observations and Twinkle may very well provide a vantage point to plan Ariel observations. The true extent of the potential synergies, far beyond our considered sample, will be determined by the final target lists. Once Twinkle is operational and its performance is known, it could reliably inform Ariel&#39;s target prioritization and Ariel&#39;s capabilities which are already well-established can help define optimal targets and observational approaches for Twinkle.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks, severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically, we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions. Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities, achieving superior performance to baseline methods.

Building directly on the original formulation, our approach naturally accommodates additional degrees of freedom and provides a unified, minimal framework for parametrising the Yukawa sector. It significantly simplifies both analytical treatments and numerical scans, and can be universally applied to any Majorana neutrino mass model, regardless of the underlying dynamics. The approach also offers a unified framework for classifying neutrino mass models according to the structure of the neutrino mass matrix, which naturally motivates the proposal of an extended version of the Scotogenic Model. This classification scheme yields tree-level (loop-level) representative models: the seesaw (Scotogenic Model), the linear seesaw (the Generalised Scotogenic Model), and the linear plus inverse seesaw (the Extended Scotogenic Model). We provide ready-to-use explicit expressions for several well-known scenarios, including the Zee model where one of the Yukawa matrices is antisymmetric.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hastie et al. (2022) found that ridge regularization is essential in high dimensional linear regression $y=\beta^Tx + \epsilon$ with isotropic co-variates $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $n$ samples at fixed $d/n$. However, Hastie et al. (2022) also notes that when the co-variates are anisotropic and $\beta$ is aligned with the top eigenvalues of population covariance, the &#34;situation is qualitatively different.&#34; In the present article, we make precise this observation for linear regression with highly anisotropic covariances and diverging $d/n$. We find that simply scaling up (or inflating) the minimum $\ell_2$ norm interpolator by a constant greater than one can improve the generalization error. This is in sharp contrast to traditional regularization/shrinkage prescriptions. Moreover, we use a data-splitting technique to produce consistent estimators that achieve generalization error comparable to that of the optimally inflated minimum-norm interpolator. Our proof relies on apparently novel matching upper and lower bounds for expectations of Gaussian random projections for a general class of anisotropic covariance matrices when $d/n\to \infty$.</div>

It provides a powerful and novel tool to constrain the transport coefficients of heavy quarks in the QGP and, more generally, to assess the strength of the interaction of a Brownian particle in an expanding bulk medium. The results further indicate that heavy quarks exhibit collective behavior driven by the isotropic expansion of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions and, at low $p_T$, it offers a marked signature of the heavy quark hadronization mechanism.</div>

The contribution of high-dimensional operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) grows increasingly important as experimental precision improves at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in future colliders. However, the number of operators increases very rapidly with dimension, making it extremely challenging to identify their complete set. In our previous work \cite{Jin:2020pwh}, we proposed a systematic method for generating gluonic operators using primitive operators. In this paper, we introduce a graphical representation of gluonic operators and, based on this representation, present a method to systematically construct primitive operators. Using this method, we derive primitive operators corresponding to gluonic operators of length 2 to length 7 in $D$-dimensions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL), which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters. Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities, thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The forward neutrino program at the Large Hadron Collider has entered the era of providing the first measurements and observations. As it has notable connections to astrophysics and will complement the results and projections of key measurements at the LHC and other measurements, it is becoming increasingly important for collider physicists to recognize and utilize the unique potential of this novel research direction. The present work reviews a selection of questions related to the nature, masses and interactions of neutrinos, and highlights some of the recent projections for the LHC Run 3 as well as the high-luminosity run.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles ($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} &gt; 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$ properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to the observer&#39;s screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the single-disk case, and the shadow&#39;s size reduction far more acute, making a neat distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their multi-ring structure.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) we performed an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by $\mu_{g,0}\ge24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.5$ kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies ($\mu_{g,0}\ge23.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.3$ kpc). Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of a UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc), with a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir, $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.95\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.60\pm0.04$. UDG-1&#39;s stellar mass and star formation rate are also approximately an order of magnitude larger at $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.07\pm0.12$ and $\log_{10}(SFR/\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}) = -1.26\pm0.12$ respectively. The pair has an isolated local environment, with no other galaxies or H I sources within 30 arcmin (525 kpc) and $\pm1000$ km s$^{-1}$. However, in the context of the larger-scale structure, the pair is located outside the virial radius of the Hydra cluster, with its position on the phase-space diagram indicating that it is infalling into the cluster. The identification of this H I-bearing UDG pair raises important questions around the formation of such a unique system and the evolution of UDGs in a transitional phase before ram pressure stripping and cluster infall.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We provide insight about the full form of the equations for matter density perturbations and the scalar Bardeen metric potentials in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity. When considering viable modifications to the standard $\Lambda$CDM background, the full scale-dependent equations for the metric perturbations are provided and are shown to match the ones obtained with the quasistatic approximation. We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of $\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the quasistatic approximation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Radio observations provide a window into a planet&#39;s interior and play a crucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find potential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with advances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates the search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric Bode&#39;s law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330 confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission. Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses indicate that a planet&#39;s mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency. The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics, confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA* deployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209 mJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b, with a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate for SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as MASCARA-1 b (SNR&gt;400) and WASP-18 b (SNR&gt;4236), within feasible integration times. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b, WASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching, highlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for observation campaigns.</div>

Since the publication of the seminal survey by Bertoin and Yor, substantial advances have been made in understanding the structure and properties of these random variables. At the same time, numerous applications of these quantities have emerged across various different contexts of modern applied probability. Motivated by all this, in this manuscript, we provide a detailed overview of these developments, beginning with a discussion of the class of special functions that have played a central role in recent progress, and then organising the main results on exponential functionals into thematic groups. Moreover, we complement several of these results and set them within a unified framework. Throughout, we strive to offer a coherent historical account of each contribution, highlighting both the probabilistic and analytical techniques that have driven the advances in the field.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or $\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted&#39; extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method. Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and real-world precipitation downscaling problems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro). Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering, are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs. classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with potential applications in risk management where understanding structural co-movements is crucial.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The absence of a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) constrains the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theta angle to be less than one part in ten billion, posing the Strong $CP$ problem. We revisit two classes of proposed solutions. First, we show that when $P$ or $CP$ is realized as a gauged discrete symmetry - as can arise in quantum gravity - the vacuum necessarily preserves $CP$, contrary to recent claims that discrete-symmetry solutions fail. Gauged discrete models face model-building challenges, such as avoiding contributions to the neutron EDM after spontaneous $P$ or $CP$ breaking, but in principle have no fundamental obstructions. Second, we critically examine recent arguments that the Strong $CP$ problem is illusory, demonstrating that a nonzero neutron EDM at finite $\bar\theta$ follows directly from well-understood QCD dynamics. Taken together, our results reinforce the reality of the Strong $CP$ problem and highlight gauged discrete-symmetry realizations of $P$ or $CP$ as plausible solutions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We reinterpret the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ measurement as a probe of the decay $B^+ \to K^+ a$, where $a$ denotes an axion or axion-like particle. This is possible in the kinematic regions where the di-neutrino invariant mass squared, $q^2$, can be identified with the assumed $m_a^2$. While $q^2$ is reconstructed only in the Hadronic Tag Analysis (HTA), it is not directly accessible in the Inclusive Tag Analysis (ITA), which provides much larger statistics and hence higher sensitivity. In ITA, $q^2$ is proxied by a reconstructed variable, $q^2_{\text{rec}}$, usually modeled through Belle II simulations. We show that the mapping between $q^2$ and $q^2_{\text{rec}}$ can be accurately derived from kinematic arguments alone -- without relying on internal experimental inputs. Using this relation and publicly available efficiencies, we obtain the strongest existing bounds on the coupling-rescaled Peccei-Quinn scale, $|(F_V)_{sb}| \ge 0.9 \times 10^9$ GeV, improving the latest bound in the literature by an order of magnitude. We further show that the bound depends only marginally on the assumed value of the di-neutrino signal strength $\mu_{\nu{\bar\nu}}$, whether fixed or floated. This establishes $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar \nu$ as a double probe -- of new short-distance physics in the $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar\nu$ amplitude, and of new light, elusive particles produced via $B^+ \to K^+ a$ -- the two probes working independently to an excellent approximation.</div>

We used data from the SDSS DR10 MAIN galaxy sample and from DESI cluster catalogues. The projected phase space diagram and the distribution of mass were used to identify regions of various infall stages (early and late infall, and regions of ongoing infall, i.e. regions of influence), their characteristic radii, embedded mass, and density contrasts in order to study the evolution of clusters with the spherical collapse model. We determined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and their connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster&#39;s regions of influence, analysed galaxy content of clusters, and derived scaling relations between cluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five components and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of influence are $R_\mathrm{inf} \approx 4$ Mpc, and the density contrast at their borders is $\Delta\rho_{inf} \approx 50 - 60$. The scaling relations between the masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the clusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In superclusters the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in low-density regions between superclusters. The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts $z \approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will be virialised in $\approx 3.3$ Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in $\approx 10$ Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ($10^8&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as $\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in $\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption, especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass, the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller $R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies ($0.02$\,$&lt;$\,z\,$&lt;$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion&#39;s SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR) reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components (PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by softening PCR&#39;s hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR&#39;s stability and flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2 models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule&#39;s high discriminative power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training, we train sliding window generative neural networks using a predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\log M_\star/M_\odot &gt; 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1&#39; 11$), we achieve a $5\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\bar \tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r&lt;r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k&lt;1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z&lt;3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $&lt;225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z&gt;2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $&gt;5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.</div>

A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it&#39;s unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator&#39;s performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the Milky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the upcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of known streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of individual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality and quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold for all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with the progenitor&#39;s mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a subset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and completeness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream detection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual expectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in the multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters to account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog tailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and completeness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| &gt; 30 degree.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$&#39;s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$&#39;s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$&#39;s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$&#39;s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace. Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition, which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge. As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods, tasks, and model architectures.</div>

In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs), where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However, most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning? Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However, they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance. Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace. IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The formation and evolution of galaxies and other astrophysical objects have become of great interest, especially since the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. The mass, size, and density of objects in the early universe appear to be drastically different from those predicted by the standard cosmology - the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work shows that the mass-size-density evolution is not surprising when we use the CCC+TL cosmology, which is based on the concepts of covarying coupling constants in an expanding universe and the tired light effect contributing to the observed redshift. This model is consistent with supernovae Pantheon+ data, the angular size of the cosmic dawn galaxies, BAO, CMB sound horizon, galaxy formation time scales, time dilation, galaxy rotation curves, etc., and does not have the coincidence problem. The effective radii $r_e$ of the objects are larger in the new model by $r_e \propto (1+z)^{0.93}$. Thus, the object size evolution in different studies, estimated as $r_e \propto (1+z)^s$ with $s=-1.0 \pm {0.3}$, is modified to $r_e \propto (1+z)^{s+0.93}$, the dynamical mass by $(1+z)^{0.93}$, and number density by $(1+z)^{-2.80}$. The luminosity modification increases slowly with $z$ to 1.8 at $z=20$. Thus, the stellar mass increase is modest, and the luminosity and stellar density decrease are mainly due to the larger object size in the new model. Since the aging of the universe is stretched in the new model, its temporal evolution is much slower (e.g., at $z=10$, the age is about a dex longer); stars, black holes, and galaxies do not have to form at unrealistic rates.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Studies at the $Z$-pole have played an important role in developing our understanding of the Standard Model (SM). Continuing the explorations in this regime, we consider the possibility of the production of two $b$-quarks and a photon in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC. While such a final state is possible in the SM by means of the process $Z\rightarrow b\bar b$ decay with a radiated photon, the focus is on extracting its possible origins due to beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. The signal topology can be broadly identified as $Z\rightarrow \Phi\gamma\rightarrow b\bar b\gamma$, where $ \Phi$ can either be a spin-0 or spin-2 state with a mass less than that of the $Z$ boson.The analysis is characterised by two relatively low $p_T$ jets that are required to be $b$-tagged jets and an isolated photon. The study provides a quantitative framework for their identification and highlights the potential challenges associated with this final state. A range of machine learning architectures is employed to demonstrate the stability and reliability of the discriminating variables. This study highlights the importance of the low-$p_T$ objects in searches at the HL-LHC, hence the need to pay special attention to their identification and efficiencies.</div>

The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model&#39;s explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change, yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37 training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau} =0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9: 61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con- servation decision support systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Linear response theory is a well-established method in physics and chemistry for exploring excitations of many-body systems. In particular, the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) provides a powerful microscopic framework by building excitations on top of the mean-field vacuum; however, its high computational cost limits model calibration and uncertainty quantification studies. Here, we present two complementary QRPA surrogate models and apply them to study response functions of finite nuclei. One is a reduced-order model that exploits the underlying QRPA structure, while the other utilizes the recently developed parametric matrix model algorithm to construct a map between the system&#39;s Hamiltonian and observables. Our benchmark applications, the calculation of the electric dipole polarizability of ${}^{180}$Yb and the $\beta$-decay half-life of ${}^{80}$Ni, show that both emulators can achieve 0.1\%--1\% accuracy while offering a six to seven orders of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art QRPA solvers. These results demonstrate that the developed QRPA emulators are well-positioned to enable Bayesian calibration and large-scale studies of computationally expensive physics models describing the properties of many-body systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force community have focused on modeling these binaries&#39; inspiral regime, but for ground-based detectors the systems&#39; final merger can represent the dominant part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of variables on the binary&#39;s mechanical phase space during the transition to plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating more computational resources during the inference process. However, current research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call. To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference scaling techniques to structured outputs: &#34;explore more but retain less&#34; due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K&gt;1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR&#39;s exploration.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ultralight dark matter may couple quadratically to Standard Model particles. Such quadratic interactions give rise to both coherent and stochastic signals in pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. In this work, we characterize these signals, including the effects of dark matter propagation in a finite-density medium, and assess the sensitivity of current and upcoming PTA observations to their detection. For coherent signals, we find that the sensitivity of current PTA observations competes with and sometimes exceeds that of other probes, such as equivalence principle tests and atomic clocks. For stochastic signals, we find that PTA sensitivities underperform equivalence principle constraints for both existing and upcoming PTA data sets.</div>

These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation detectors, including LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$) using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are publicly available via $\texttt{ScholarSphere}$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe&#39;s thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a &#34;free&#34; upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This is a free textbook suitable for a one-semester course on Markov chains, covering basics of finite-state chains, many classical models, asymptotic behavior and mixing times, Monte Carlo methods, and martingales and harmonic functions. It is designed to fill a gap in the literature by being suitable for undergraduates; much of the theory is thus built from the ground up, with only basic probability and linear algebra assumed. We take as our basic framework the first four chapters of the classic Levin-Peres text &#34;Markov Chains and Mixing Times,&#34; generously expanding to make an exposition suitable for an undergraduate audience. We also incorporate over a hundred exercises and problems, along with a rich set of accompanying illustrations. Suggested homework sets are found in an appendix. Updated editions will periodically appear as new versions of this submission.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation gravitational wave observatories.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black holes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.</div>

Two functional forms of the theory are considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole&#39;s physical viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and astrophysical observations.</div>

We identify and calculate six significant ALP-production channels, two of which are loop-level processes involving photons. We then examine several observational constraints on the ALP-electron and ALP-muon parameter spaces. Those include the bounds on anomalous cooling, energy deposition, decay into photons, diffuse gamma rays, and the 511 keV line. Our results provide updated and robust constraints on ALP couplings to electrons and muons from an improved treatment of production and absorption processes. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties of the results by using three state-of-the-art supernova models based on two independent simulation codes, finding that constraints vary by factors of O(2-10).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Kepler mission, despite its conclusion over a decade ago, continues to offer a rich dataset for uncovering new astrophysical objects and phenomena. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search for exocometary transit signatures within the Kepler light curves, using a machine learning approach based on a neural network trained on a library of theoretical exocomet transit light curves. By analyzing the light curves of 201,820 stars, we identified candidate events through the neural network and subjected the output to filtering and visual inspection to mitigate false positives. Our results are presented into three catalogs of increasing ambiguity. The first-tier catalog includes 17 high-confidence exocometary transit events, comprising 7 previously reported events and 10 newly identified ones, each associated with a different host star. The second-tier catalog lists 30 lower-confidence events that remain consistent with possible exocometary transits. The third-tier catalog consists of 49 more symmetric photometric events that could be either exocometary transits, exoplanet mono-transits, or false positives due to eclipsing binaries mimicking transits. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that the cometary activity was favored by stellar youth, we find a broad age distribution among candidate host stars, including several red giants. This challenges the general idea of a decline in cometary activity with stellar age and underlines the need for further investigation into the temporal evolution of exocometary activity in planetary systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single, compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key statements generated during the model&#39;s reasoning process. Furthermore, it includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5. MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space. First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT, reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periodicity around hundreds to thousands of days have been accepted as an efficient indicator for sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN. Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely smaller than $3.3\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely higher than 5$\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future, the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.</div>

Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $&gt;3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman&#39;s high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The evolved cosmological matter density field is fully determined by the initial matter density field at fixed cosmological parameters. However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However, vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced, mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study explores the impact of observational and modelling systematic effects on cluster number counts and cluster clustering and provides model prescriptions for their joint analysis, in the context of the \Euclid survey. Using 1000 \Euclid-like cluster catalogues, we investigate the effect of systematic uncertainties on cluster summary statistics and their auto- and cross-covariance, and perform a likelihood analysis to evaluate their impact on cosmological constraints, with a focus on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and on the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$. Combining cluster clustering with number counts significantly improves cosmological constraints, with the figure of merit increasing by over 300\% compared to number counts alone. We confirm that the two probes are uncorrelated, and the cosmological constraints derived from their combination are almost insensitive to the cosmology dependence of the covariance. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties broaden cosmological posteriors by 20--30\%, while secondary effects like redshift-space distortions (RSDs) have a smaller impact on the posteriors -- 5\% for clustering alone, 10\% when combining probes -- but can significantly bias the constraints if neglected. We show that clustering data below $60\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc provides additional constraining power, while scales larger than acoustic oscillation scale add almost no information on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ parameters. RSDs and photo-$z$ uncertainties also influence the number count covariance, with a significant impact, of about 15--20\%, on the parameter constraints.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper builds upon ParamANN&#39;s novel approach (S. Pal &amp; R. Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper&#39;s ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more traditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90&#39;$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Consistency relations of large-scale structure offer a unique and powerful test of the weak equivalence principle (EP) on cosmological scales. If the EP is violated, different tracers will undergo different accelerations in response to a uniform gravitational field, and this loss of universality manifests as a dipole with a characteristic $1/K$ scale dependence in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. In this work we show that such a violation can be identified with a particular anti-symmetric {modulation} in the local cross-power spectrum of distinct tracers. Based on this observation, we propose to test the EP using quadratic estimators as a more practical alternative to the conventional approach of directly estimating the bispectrum. We apply our quadratic estimator to a DESI-like survey and forecast constraints on the overall amplitude of EP violation. Including mildly nonlinear scales in our reconstruction ($k_\mathrm{max}\simeq0.15\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), we find that our estimator is competitive with the more exhaustive direct bispectrum approach. This means surveys like DESI can already benefit from the quadratic estimator approach.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</div>

GO-Diff is trained from scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from scratch.</div>

In this study, we explore the thermodynamic aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity by establishing the first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a flat FLRW universe. By applying the Gibbs relation, we determined the rate of change of the total entropy and assessed the conditions under which the generalized second law remains valid for various choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$. Our analysis focuses on linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and cross-coupling models, inspired by frameworks such as $f(R,\mathcal{T})$, $f(T)$, and modifications motivated by string theory. Our analysis showed that linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent, whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned parameters for the generalized second law to hold. The present analysis underscores that thermodynamic considerations serve as effective criteria for assessing the viability of modified gravity models and their relevance to cosmological dynamics.</div>

With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns, lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT), which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.</div>

However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model&#39;s final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model&#39;s judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In massless scalar field cosmology, imposing the universe&#39;s physical volume as fundamentally discrete resolves the big bang singularity via a big bounce. We use quantum field theory on curved background to numerically track the number of particles created in the vacuum of a quantum field that propagates through the cosmological bounce. We find that due to geometry&#39;s evolution, particle production in all modes initially rises, sharply peaks at the bounce, and varies slowly afterwards. Further, by comparing with the case of a quantum field propagating on an expanding universe, we discover that the bouncing universe&#39;s imprints on quantum matter are distinct: notably, the late time particle production across modes resembles a thermal spectrum. We then use semiclassical gravity and find similar qualitative results. Here, we also determine how particle production affects geometry&#39;s evolution. Our study adds to existing literature on gravity-matter interactions in the context of a bouncing universe, contributes to searches of a bouncing universe&#39;s signatures, and strengthens the link between gravity and thermodynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott&#39;s rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The buoyancy stability properties of the ICM are modified because of the anisotropic transport of heat along the magnetic field lines. This feature gives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear analyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the conduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might be a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess the impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another goal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and their MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a new benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat flux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis of the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of analytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a pseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global MTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth rates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined within an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed to grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the global mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to that of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully reproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than 1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of the global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any astrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (&gt; 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called &#34;Fujii relation&#34;) and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">An analysis of baryogenesis and stochastic gravitational wave production is presented for an extension of the standard model where the dark sector consists of dark matter particles charged under a $U(1)_x$ gauge symmetry, while a subset of dark fields also carry lepton number but no $U(1)_x$ charge. We demonstrate that with CP violation induced by Yukawa couplings, equal and opposite lepton asymmetries are generated in the visible and hidden sectors. Subsequent evolution preserves lepton number separately in each sector, and sphaleron interactions partially convert the lepton asymmetry into baryon asymmetry near the temperature of the first-order phase transition. Further, we discuss stochastic gravitational wave background production for the first-order phase transition using a gauge-independent bubble nucleation dynamics which yields spectra also valid in the supercooled low-temperature regime with {$T_p/m_{A_x} \ll 1$} where $T_p$ is the percolation temperature and $m_{A_x}$ is the dark photon mass. A parameter-space scan identifies regions that simultaneously account for cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter and predict stochastic gravitational wave signals within reach of current (NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA) and future detectors at higher frequencies, providing a unified framework for cogenesis and associated gravitational wave production.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">While ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state could naturally account for the central core in some galaxies and resolve the core-cusp problem, the dark matter density distribution in the outer regions of galaxies remains less explored. We propose a trial wavefunction to model the ULDM distribution beyond the BEC core. We derive the corresponding rotation velocity curve, which shows excellent agreement with those of 12 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The best-fit ULDM particle mass for each dwarf galaxy falls within a strikingly narrow range of $m=(1.8-3.2)\times 10^{-23}\text{eV}$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment. We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes. When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$. Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience, increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs. However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained inference models.</div>

Auxiliary information, such as noisy observations, is typically only available at discrete times, and incorporating it via a Doob&#39;s $h-$transform gives rise to an intractable posterior process that requires approximation. We introduce Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a model class parameterizing the generator of each Markov chain in the system. Our inference method involves estimating look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, for which we introduce an efficient parameterization. We incorporate this approximation in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a challenging posterior inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph, and on a neural model for wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model&#39;s solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model&#39;s actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.</div>

To answer this question, we explored the evolution of long-lived (&gt; 1 Gyr) star clusters in Milky Way-galaxy simulations. In particular, we investigated why some star clusters remain bound over billions of years. We have traced the unique trajectories for a sample of open clusters around two FIRE galaxies throughout cosmic time. Additionally, we characterized the small-scale environment surrounding these clusters over their orbital history. We see that clusters across both FIRE galaxies spend the majority of their lives in under-dense regions of gas, except for brief passages where they interact with gas clouds, causing their orbits to be altered.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like &#34;clever but clueless interns&#34; in novel environments. This severely limits their practical utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection, memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines. On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance, outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win any.</div>

Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic&#39;s guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Asymptotic efficiency theory is one of the pillars in the foundations of modern mathematical statistics. Not only does it serve as a rigorous theoretical benchmark for evaluating statistical methods, but it also sheds light on how to develop and unify novel statistical procedures. For example, the calculus of influence functions has led to many important statistical breakthroughs in the past decades. Responding to the pressing challenge of analyzing increasingly complex datasets, particularly those with non-Euclidean/nonlinear structures, many novel statistical models and methods have been proposed in recent years. However, the existing efficiency theory is not always readily applicable to these cases, as the theory was developed, for the most part, under the often neglected premise that both the sample space and the parameter space are normed linear spaces. As a consequence, efficiency results outside normed linear spaces are quite rare and isolated, obtained on a case-by-case basis. This paper aims to develop a more unified asymptotic efficiency theory, allowing the sample space, the parameter space, or both to be Riemannian manifolds satisfying certain regularity conditions. We build a vocabulary that helps translate essential concepts in efficiency theory from normed linear spaces to Riemannian manifolds, such as (locally) regular estimators, differentiable functionals, etc. Efficiency bounds are established under conditions parallel to those for normed linear spaces. We also demonstrate the conceptual advantage of the new framework by applying it to two concrete examples in statistics: the population Frechet mean and the regression coefficient vector of Single-Index Models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage. As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL), planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens, revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the mating-of-trees approach to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), it is natural to consider two pairs of correlated Brownian motions coupled together. This arises in the scaling limit of bipolar-orientation-decorated planar maps (Gwynne-Holden-Sun, 2016) and in the related skew Brownian permuton studied by Borga et al. There are two parameters that can be used to index the coupling between the two pairs of Brownian motions, denoted as $p$ and $\theta$ in the literature: $p$ describes the Brownian motions, whereas $\theta$ describes the SLE curves on LQG surfaces. In this paper, we derive an exact relation between the two parameters and demonstrate its application to computing statistics of the skew Brownian permuton. Our derivation relies on the synergy between mating-of-trees and Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), where the boundary three-point function in LCFT provide the exact solvable inputs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However, they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges, and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every topological level through independent random components. Motivated by applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO&#39;s shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale offers several theoretical and phenomenological advantages, such as accommodating the observed Higgs mass and alleviating the flavor and CP problems. However, flavor and CP observables still impose stringent constraints even at the PeV scale, motivating a systematic study of flavor symmetries in this regime. In this work, we investigate nucleon decay induced by dimension-five operators in supersymmetric standard models and examine how flavor symmetries, particularly of the Froggatt-Nielsen type, can suppress these operators. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining flavor, CP, and proton-decay observables to quantify the allowed parameter space and identify characteristic predictions. Our results demonstrate that a multi-messenger approach, integrating flavor, CP, and baryon-number-violating observables, is essential for probing the underlying structure of supersymmetry beyond the TeV scale.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human&#39;s empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Scotogenic mechanism is an appealing pathway to naturally explain the common origin of dark matter and tiny neutrino mass. However, the conventional scotogenic dark matter usually suffers stringent constraints from the non-observation of lepton flavor violation and direct detection. To generate the non-zero neutrino masses, at least two generations of dark particles are required. For example, two real scalar singlets $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are involved in the scotogenic inverse model, which are odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry. In this paper, we consider the masses of dark scalars are nearly degenerate $m_{\phi_1}\lesssim m_{\phi_2}$, which opens new viable pathway for the generation of dark matter $\phi_1$, such as the coscattering process $\phi_1\text{SM}\to \phi_2 \text{SM}$ and coannihilation processes $\phi_1 \phi_2 \to \text{SM SM}$ via the Higgs portal or Yukawa portal interactions. We explore the parameter space to produce the correct relic density through coscattering, as well as the contrastive coannihilation channel. We then comprehensively study the constraints of dark matter from Higgs decay, direct detection, and indirect detection. For the heavier dark scalar, the three-body decay $\phi_2\to\phi_1 f\bar{f}$ not only alerts the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background, but also leads to the observable displaced vertex signature at colliders.</div>

Primordial magnetic fields present before decoupling have an effect on the linear matter power spectrum. The redshifted 21 cm line signal is observed at different frequencies allowing to determine multifrequency angular power spectra. These are presented for cosmological models including the adiabatic, primordial curvature mode as well as the compensated magnetic mode for different values of the magnetic field parameters. For multifrequency angular power spectra frequency ranges have been set around central frequencies of uGMRT Band 3 data as well as MeerKAT L band data. For these signal-over-noise ratios are obtained as well as for SKA1-MID which is part of the currently under construction SKAO.</div>

Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d&gt;5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information processing in curved spacetime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Pluto and Charon are a dwarf binary system with a high mass ratio $\mu$, preventing Trojan companions. This instability creates ideal intersections for low-energy pathways that spacecraft can traverse and serves as an important test case for stability at Lagrange points for high $\mu$ binaries. This study models the Pluto-Charon system in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) and compares the tadpole and horseshoe orbits of a massless particle with known low-$\mu$ orbits. Moreover, it compares the trajectories for instances where the L1 neck is opened and closed, and exhibits the corresponding zero-velocity curves; RK4 integration was used to update the position and velocity of the particle. The simulations consistently showed chaotic and unpredictable trajectories, where small changes in initial parameters could completely alter the results; trajectories displayed the influence of higher values of $\mu$ on the stability of binary systems. These findings confirm that Pluto-Charon cannot host long-lived Trojan companions and instead behaves as a system of chaotic transport. Future work could extend the study to include the spatial or elliptic three-body problem, further refining the understanding of instability in high-$\mu$ binaries.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore&#39;s effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Convolutional neural networks are increasingly being used to analyze and classify material microstructures, motivated by the possibility that they will be able to identify relevant microstructural features more efficiently and impartially than human experts. While up to now convolutional neural networks have mostly been applied to light optimal microscopy and scanning electron microscope micrographs, application to EBSD micrographs will be increasingly common as rational design generates materials with unknown textures and phase compositions. This raises the question of how crystallographic orientation should be represented in such a convolutional neural network, and whether this choice has a significant effect on the network&#39;s analysis and classification accuracy. Four representations of orientation information are examined and are used with convolutional neural networks to classify five synthetic microstructures with varying textures and grain geometries. Of these, a spectral embedding of crystallographic orientations in a space that respects the crystallographic symmetries performs by far the best, even when the network is trained on small volumes of data such as could be accessible by practical experiments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We performed a statistical study of two old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 using Gaia DR3 data. No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most likely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane. The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt &amp; Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude -- color index&#39; diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system&#39;s continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model&#39;s latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system&#39;s outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today&#39;s flag-and-block guardrails.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A fundamental problem in statistics is estimating the shape matrix of an Elliptical distribution. This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian covariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal estimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural M-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime, independent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that this estimator performs very well, and that Tyler&#39;s iterative procedure converges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the first distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as the first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler&#39;s iterative procedure. However, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by a $\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold and error bounds for Tyler&#39;s M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions, fully matching the Gaussian result. Moreover, we recover the algorithmic convergence even at this lower sample threshold. Our approach builds on the operator scaling connection of Franks and Moitra by introducing a novel pseudorandom condition, which we call $\infty$-expansion. We show that Elliptical distributions satisfy $\infty$-expansion at the optimal sample threshold, and then prove a novel scaling result for inputs satisfying this condition.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are frequently misaligned with the humans&#39; true, unobservable objectives, and thus act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human&#39;s true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class. Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class imbalance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Starting from Greg Moore&#39;s description about Physical Mathematics, a framework is proposed in order to understand it, based on Gilles Ch\^atelet&#39;s philosophy. It will be argued that Ch\^atelet&#39;s ideas of inverting, splitting, augmenting and virtuality are crucial in the discussion about the nature of Physical Mathematics. Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Ch\^atelet&#39;s ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80&#39;s of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Ch\^atelet in the beginning of the 90&#39;s. The main suggestion of the essay is that it is in the relations between mathematics, physics and philosophy that new knowledge arises.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Traditional likelihood based methods for parameter estimation get highly affected when the given data is contaminated by outliers even in a small proportion. In this paper, we consider a robust parameter estimation method, namely the minimum logarithmic norm relative entropy (LNRE) estimation procedure, and study different (generalized) sufficiency principles associated with it. We introduce a new two-parameter power-law family of distributions (namely, $\mathcal{M}^{(\alpha,\beta)}$-family), which is shown to have a fixed number of sufficient statistics, independent of the sample size, with respect to the generalized likelihood function associated with the LNRE. Then, we obtain the generalized minimal sufficient statistic for this family and derive the generalized Rao-Blackwell theorem and the generalized Cram\&#39;{e}r-Rao lower bound for the minimum LNRE estimation. We also study the minimum LNRE estimators (MLNREEs) for the family of Student&#39;s distributions particularly in detail. Our general results reduces to the classical likelihood based results under the exponential family of distributions at specific choices of the tuning parameter $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Finally, we present simulation studies followed by a real data analysis, which highlight the practical utility of the MLNREEs for data contaminated by possible outliers. Along the way we also correct a mistake found in a recent paper on related theory of generalized likelihoods.</div>

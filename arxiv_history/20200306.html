To this end we used a catalogue of small galaxy systems comprising compact and locally isolated pairs, triplets and groups with four and up to six galaxies. We consider fixed aperture estimators and found that at scales lower than 5 Mpc pairs are associated to lower density environments than triplets and groups. Moreover a nearest neighbour approach highlights that triplets prefer denser environments than pairs and slightly less dense environments than groups. When considering the position within the cosmic web we found that pairs and triplets in our sample are associated to void environments while galaxy groups are more likely to reside in void walls. In agreement with these results, the system-galaxy cross-correlation function shows that pairs inhabit environments of lesser density compared to triplets and groups, and on small scales (&lt; 3Mpc) triplets appear to behave as an intermediate system. Related to the properties of neighbour galaxies of small systems we found that the neighbours of groups present a lower fractions of star forming, young stellar population and blue colour galaxies with respect to neighbours of triplet and pair systems. These results suggest that differences in the properties of galaxies in pairs, triplets and groups are not only related to the existence of an extra galaxy member but also to the large scale environment inhabited by the systems. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02785">arXiv</a>,

Lambas</a><br><br>We aim at defining homogeneous selection criteria of small galaxy systems in order to build catalogues suitable to compare main properties of pairs, triplets, and groups with four or more members. To this end we use spectroscopic and photometric SDSS data to identify systems with a low number of members. We study global properties of these systems and the properties of their member galaxies finding that galaxies in groups are systematically redder and with lower star formation activity indicators than galaxies in pairs which have a higher fraction of star forming galaxies. Triplet galaxies present intermediate trends between pairs and groups. We also find an enhancement of star formation activity for galaxies in small systems with companions closer than 100kpc, irrespective the number of members. We have tested these analysis on SDSS mock catalogues derived from the Millennium simulation, finding as conservative thresholds 76% completeness and a contamination of 23% in small galaxy systems, when considering an extreme case of incompleteness due to fiber collisions. Nevertheless, we also found that the results obtained are not likely affected by projection effects. Our studies suggest that an extra galaxy in a system modify the properties of the member galaxies. In pairs, galaxy-galaxy interactions increases gas density and trigger starbursts. However, repeated interactions in triplets and groups can generate gas stripping, turbulence and shocks quenching the star formation in these systems. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02784">arXiv</a>,

These disturbed and asymmetric features are the indicators of galaxy interaction. We study the velocity field of the ionized gas of the paired galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. Using the kinemetry package, we fit the velocity field of the ionized gas to quantify the degree of kinematic asymmetry. We find that the star formation rate (SFR) of the paired galaxies with high kinematic asymmetry is significantly enhanced even when the projected separation between the pair members is quite large (dp~100 kpc). On the contrary, no significant SFR enhancement is found for the paired galaxies with low kinematic asymmetry even when their projected separation is small (dp &lt; 30 kpc). Moreover, we also find that the fraction of galaxies with high kinematic asymmetry is much higher in close pairs (dp &lt; 30 kpc) than those with larger dp, which explains well the early statistical findings of the significant SFR enhancement in close pairs. Our new findings illustrate that the kinematic asymmetry is an excellent indicator of galaxy-galaxy interaction strength, which helps us better understand the merging stage of the observed galaxy pairs. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02493">arXiv</a>,

Placco</a><br><br>CEMP-no stars, a subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, are one of the most significant stellar populations in Galactic Archaeology, because they dominate the low end of the metallicity distribution function, providing information on the early star-formation and chemical-evolution history of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies. Here we present an analysis of medium-resolution ($R \sim 1,800$) optical spectroscopy for a CEMP giant, SDSS J132755.56+333521.7, observed with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), one of the brightest ($g \sim 20.5$) members of the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Canes Venatici I (CVn I). Many CEMP stars discovered to date have very cool effective temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt; 4500$ K), resulting in strong veiling by molecular carbon bands over their optical spectra at low/medium spectral resolution. We introduce a technique to mitigate the carbon-veiling problem to obtain reliable stellar parameters and validate this method with the LBT medium-resolution optical spectra of the ultra metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-4.0$) CEMP-no dwarf, G 77-61, and seven additional very cool CEMP stars, which have published high-resolution spectroscopic parameters. We apply this technique to the LBT spectrum of SDSS J132755.56+333521.7. We find that this star is well-described with parameters $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=4530$ K, log $g=$ 0.7, [Fe/H] $ = -3.38$, and absolute carbon abundance $A$(C) = 7.23, indicating that it is likely the first Group III CEMP-no star identified in CVn I. The Group III identification of this star suggests that it is a member of the extremely metal-poor population in CVn I, which may have been accreted into its halo. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10038">arXiv</a>,

In this paper, we use the halo model formalism to capture this diversity and examine its implications for a Stage III cosmic shear survey. We account for the different IA signatures at large and small scales as well for the different contribution from central/satellite and red/blue galaxies. We inform our model using the most recent observational findings: we include a luminosity dependence at both large and small scales and a radial dependence of the signal within the halo. We predict the impact of the total IA signal on the lensing angular power spectra, including the current uncertainties from the IA best-fits to illustrate the range of possible impact on the lensing signal: the lack of constraints for fainter galaxies is the main source of uncertainty for our predictions of the IA signal. We investigate how well the widely used non-linear alignment model can capture the complexity of the IA signal and find that while for Stage III surveys it is flexible enough, in the case of a Stage IV survey, this can lead to $1\sigma$ bias on $\Omega_m$. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02700">arXiv</a>,

Beasley</a><br><br>We present a new set of Surface Brightness Fluctuation spectra computed with the E-MILES stellar population synthesis models. The model SBF spectra cover the range 1680-50000 Angstrom at moderately high resolution, all based on extensive empirical stellar libraries. The models span the metallicity range -2.3&lt;[M/H&lt;+0.26 for a suite of IMF types with varying slopes. These predictions can complement and aid fluctuation magnitudes studies, permitting a first order approximation by applying filter responses to the SBF spectra to obtain spectroscopic SBF magnitudes. We provide a recipe for obtaining the latter and discuss their uncertainties and limitations. We compare our spectroscopic SBF magnitudes to photometric data of a sample of early-type galaxies. We also show that the SBF spectra can be very useful for constraining relevant stellar population parameters. We find small (&lt;5%) mass-fractions of extremely metal-poor components ([M/H]&lt;-1) on the top of the dominant, old and metal-rich stellar population. These results put stringent constraints on the early stages of galaxy formation in massive elliptical galaxies. This is remarkable given the high degree of degeneracy of the standard spectral analysis to such metal-poor stellar populations in the visible and in the near-IR.

Wuensche</a><br><br>In this paper we explore the potential astrophysical signatures of dark matter (DM) annihilations in ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) considering two of the richest known galaxy clusters within 100 million light-years, nominally, Virgo and Fornax. Fornax UCD3 is the most luminous UCD and M59 UCD3 is the most massive UCD. With the detection of a 3.5 million solar mass black hole (BH) in Fornax UCD3, we carefully model several DM enhanced profiles scenarios, considering both the presence of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and DM. For Fornax UCD3, the comparison of the stellar and dynamical masses suggests that there is little content of DM in UCDs. M59 UCD3 did not receive the same attention in simulations as Fornax UCD3, but deep radio imaging and X-ray observations were performed for M59 UCD3 and can be used to place limits in DM content of these UCDs. We work with an average estimative of dark matter content considering the Salpeter and Kroupa mass functions. We model Fornax UCD3 and M59 UCD3 to have a DM content that is the average of these mass functions. We then analyze the constraints for Fornax and M59 UCD3 coming from gamma-ray and radio sources considering in our simulations, a dark matter particle with mass between $10-34\,{\rm GeV}$. In the absence of strong $\gamma$-ray signatures, we show that synchrotron emission from electrons and positrons produced by DM annihilations can be very sensitive to indirect DM search. We find that DM parameters can be significantly constrained at radio frequencies and the spike profiles play an interesting rule in order to deep study the enhancements of DM \&amp; BH interactions in ultracompact galaxies. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02383">arXiv</a>,

G. Robotham</a><br><br>We use our catalogue of structural decomposition measurements for the extended GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (xGASS) to study the role of bulges both along and across the galaxy star-forming main sequence (SFMS). We show that the slope in the $sSFR$-$M_{\star}$ relation flattens by $\sim$0.1 dex per decade in $M_{\star}$ when re-normalising $sSFR$ by disc stellar mass instead of total stellar mass. However, recasting the $sSFR$-$M_{\star}$ relation into the framework of only disc-specific quantities shows that a residual trend remains against disc stellar mass with equivalent slope and comparable scatter to that of the total galaxy relation. This suggests that the residual declining slope of the SFMS is intrinsic to the disc components of galaxies. We further investigate the distribution of bulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$) as a function of distance from the SFMS ($\Delta SFR_{MS}$). At all stellar masses, the average $B/T$ of local galaxies decreases monotonically with increasing $\Delta SFR_{MS}$. Contrary to previous works, we find that the upper-envelope of the SFMS is not dominated by objects with a significant bulge component. This rules out a scenario in which, in the local Universe, objects with increased star formation activity are simultaneously experiencing a significant bulge growth. We suggest that much of the discrepancies between different works studying the role of bulges originates from differences in the methodology of structurally decomposing galaxies. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02464">arXiv</a>,

Silva Aguirre</a><br><br>In their evolution, star-forming galaxies are known to follow scaling relations between some fundamental physical quantities, such as the mass-metallicity and the main sequence relations. We aim at studying the evolution of galaxies that, at a given redshift, lie simultaneously on the mass-metallicity (MZ) and main sequence (MS) relations. To this aim, we use the analytical, 'leaky-box' chemical evolution model of Spitoni et al. (2017), in which galaxy evolution is described by an infall timescale $\tau$ and a wind efficiency $\lambda$. We provide a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of galactic metallicity, stellar mass, mass-weighted age and gas fraction. The evolution of the galaxies lying on the MZ and MS at $z\sim0.1$ suggests that the average infall time-scale in two different bins of stellar masses ($M_{\star}&lt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\star}&gt;10^{10} M_{\odot}$) decreases with decreasing redshift. This means that at each redshift, only the youngest galaxies can be assembled on the shortest timescales and still belong to the MS. In the lowest mass bin, a decrease of the median $\tau$ is accompanied by an increase of the median $\lambda$ value. This implies that systems which have formed at more recent times will need to eject a larger amount of mass to keep their metallicity at low values. Another important result is that galactic downsizing, as traced by the age-mass relation, is naturally recovered by imposing that local galaxies lie on both the MZ and MS. Finally, we study the evolution of the hosts of C IV-selected AGN, which at $z\sim 2$ follow a flat MZ, as found by Mignoli et al. (2019). If we impose that these systems lie on the MS, at lower redshifts we find an 'inverted' MZ, meaning that some additional processes must be at play in their evolution. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02347">arXiv</a>,

However, the observed line-of-sight escape profile is known to be suppressed compared to the underlying radial (or tangential) escape profile. Past work has suggested that velocity anisotropy in the phase-space data is the root cause. Instead we find that the observed suppression is from the statistical under-sampling of the phase-spaces and that the radial escape edge can be accurately inferred from projected data. We build an analytical model for this suppression which only requires the number of observed galaxies $N$ in the phase-space data within the sky-projected range $0.3 \le r/R_{200,critical} \le 1$. The suppression function is an inverse power-law $Z_v = 1 + (N_0/N)^\lambda$ with $N_0 = 14.205$ and $\lambda= 0.467$. We test our model with N-body simulations, using dark matter particles, sub-halos, and semi-analytic galaxies as the phase-space tracers and find percent level accuracy and precision. We show that this suppression function is independent of cluster mass, cosmology, and velocity anisotropy. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02733">arXiv</a>,

The advent of localized FRBs with host galaxy redshifts allows the various emission models to be directly tested for the first time. Given the recent localizations of two non-repeating FRBs (FRB 180924 and FRB 190523), we discuss a selection of FRB emission models and demonstrate how we can place constraints on key model parameters like the strength of the putative FRB emitting neutron star's magnetic field and the age of the system. In particular, we focus on models related to compact binary merger events involving at least one neutron star, motivated by commonalities between the host galaxies of the FRBs and the hosts of such merger events/short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). We rule out the possibility that either FRB was produced during the final inspiral stage of a merging binary system. Where possible, we predict the light curve of electromagnetic emission associated with a given model and use these to recommend multi-wavelength follow-up strategies that may help confirm or rule out models for future FRBs. In addition, we conduct a targeted sub-threshold search in Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data for potential SGRB candidates associated with either FRB, and show what a non-detection means for relevant models. The methodology presented in this study may be easily applied to future localized FRBs, and adapted to sources with possibly core-collapse supernova progenitors, to help constrain potential models for the FRB population at large. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02706">arXiv</a>,

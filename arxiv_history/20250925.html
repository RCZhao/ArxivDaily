                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We measure the correspondence between the distribution of galaxies and matter around troughs and peaks in the projected galaxy density, by comparing \texttt{redMaGiC} galaxies ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.65$) to weak lensing mass maps from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data release. We obtain stacked profiles, as a function of angle $\theta$, of the galaxy density contrast $\delta_{\rm g}$ and the weak lensing convergence $\kappa$, in the vicinity of these identified troughs and peaks, referred to as `void&#39; and `cluster&#39; superstructures. The ratio of the profiles depend mildly on $\theta$, indicating good consistency between the profile shapes. We model the amplitude of this ratio using a function $F(\boldsymbol{\eta}, \theta)$ that depends on cosmological parameters $\boldsymbol{\eta}$, scaled by the galaxy bias. We construct templates of $F(\boldsymbol{\eta}, \theta)$ using a suite of $N$-body (`Gower Street&#39;) simulations forward-modelled with DES Y3-like noise and systematics. We discuss and quantify the caveats of using a linear bias model to create galaxy maps from the simulation dark matter shells. We measure the galaxy bias in three lens tomographic bins (near to far): $2.32^{+0.86}_{-0.27}, 2.18^{+0.86}_{-0.23}, 1.86^{+0.82}_{-0.23}$ for voids, and $2.46^{+0.73}_{-0.27}, 3.55^{+0.96}_{-0.55}, 4.27^{+0.36}_{-1.14}$ for clusters, assuming the best-fit \textit{Planck} cosmology. Similar values with $\sim0.1\sigma$ shifts are obtained assuming the mean DES Y3 cosmology. The biases from troughs and peaks are broadly consistent, although a larger bias is derived for peaks, which is also larger than those measured from the DES Y3 $3\times2$-point analysis. This method shows an interesting avenue for measuring field-level bias that can be applied to future lensing surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy clusters, the most massive, dark-matter-dominated, and most recently assembled structures in the Universe, are key tools for probing cosmology. However, uncertainties in scaling relations that connect cluster mass to observables like X-ray luminosity and temperature remain a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive investigation of 329 simulated clusters from Illustris TNG300 cosmological simulations. Our analysis involves cross-correlating dark matter and the hot X-ray-emitting gas, considering both the 3D and 2D projected distributions to account for projection effects. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective in evaluating the dynamical state of these systems and validating the often-utilized assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is key for inferring cluster masses and constructing scaling relations. Our study revisits both the X-ray luminosity-mass and X-ray temperature-mass scaling relations, and demonstrates how the scatter in these relations correlates with the clusters&#39; dynamical state. We demonstrate that matter-gas coherence enables the identification of an optimal set of relaxed clusters, reducing scatter in scaling relations by up to 40%. This innovative approach, which integrates higher-dimensional insights into scaling relations, might offer a new path to further reduce uncertainties in determining cosmological parameters from galaxy clusters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational wave observations can be combined with galaxy catalogs to constrain cosmology and test modified gravity theories using the standard siren method. However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected and thereby weakening constraints or potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration, using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precision of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale also increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The gravitational collapse of collisionless matter leads to shell-crossing singularities that challenge the applicability of standard perturbation theory. Here, we present the first fully perturbative approach in three dimensions by using Lagrangian coordinates that asymptotically captures the highly nonlinear nature of matter evolution after the first shell-crossing. This is made possible essentially thanks to two basic ingredients: (1) We employ high-order standard Lagrangian perturbation theory to evolve the system until shell-crossing, and (2) we exploit the fact that the density caustic structure near the first shell-crossing begins generically with pancake formation. The latter property allows us to exploit largely known one-dimensional results to determine perturbatively the gravitational backreaction after collapse, yielding accurate solutions within our post-collapse perturbation theory (PCPT) formalism. We validate the PCPT predictions against high-resolution Vlasov-Poisson simulations and demonstrate that PCPT provides a robust framework for describing the early stages of post-collapse dynamics.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">After the observation in 2012 of a new scalar particle closely resembling the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, there is a general consensus that there must be Physics Beyond the Standard Model, with present experiments now dedicated to its discovery. Extending the scalar sector is motivated by key unresolved issues in particle physics including the need of new sources of Charge Parity violation,providing an explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe, or to explain Dark Matter, which comprises of order 85% of the matter content of the Universe. In this thesis, we focus on three Higgs doublets models (3HDM) and the constraints that need to be imposed. We add theoretical contributions for the consistency of the scalar potential, with boundedness from below and the global minimum. We consider all constraints for full phenomenological studies in models with different symmetries, studying their individual impact and attempting to distinguish the models based on data. We propose a model with CP violating coefficients, leading to Higgs couplings that significantly deviate from Standard Model values and remain allowed. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ an efficient Machine Learning algorithm that finds new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques we developed and applied. The new techniques are applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario. We connect the scalar extensions with experimentally viable solutions to the Dark Matter problem. When building Dark Matter models, one often imposes conserved discrete symmetries to stabilize DM candidates. We consider a possibility with two candidates, and an alternative possibility of a conserved non-Abelian group leading to a viable DM, in an attempt to chart the limits of what Multi-Higgs Models can accommodate.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Resolved high-redshift galaxy gas kinematics is a rapidly evolving field driven by increasingly powerful instrumentation. However, the resolution and sensitivity still impose constraints on interpretation. We investigate the uncertainties inherent to high-$z$ galaxy kinematical analysis by modelling a suite of rotating disk galaxies, generating synthetic interferometric ALMA observations, and fitting them with the 3D-kinematical tools 3DBarolo, GalPaK3D, and Qubefit. We present the recovered 3D-fitted kinematical parameters to assess their reliability, quantify the range of values possible for individual source studies, and establish the systematic biases present for observed samples. The $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ ratio, which indicates how dynamically cold a system is, is of particular importance and depends on the choice of 3D-fitting tool. On average, 3DBarolo and Qubefit slightly overestimates $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ ($&lt;1\sigma$) and GalPaK3D underestimates it ($&lt;2\sigma$). Therefore, all three tools are reliable for kinematical studies of averages of high-redshift galaxy samples. The value range possible for individual sources is significant, however, even more so for samples of not purely rotation dominated sources. To determine whether an observed galaxy is rotation dominated enough to be fitted with a 3D-kinematical tool, $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ can be extracted directly from the observed data cube, with some caveats. We recommend that the median offsets, value ranges, and tool-dependent biases presented in this paper are taken into account when interpreting 3D-fitted kinematics of observed high-redshift galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Given the mysterious nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the persistent tensions in cosmological data, it is worthwhile exploring more exotic physics in the dark sector, such as a momentum coupling between dark matter and dark energy, specifically in the form of a quintessence field. In this study, using collisionless N-body numerical simulations with a modified version of the RAMSES code, we follow up previous work to investigate the consequences of this model on dark matter halos and their substructures. We consider both the sign of the coupling and the imprints on structure formation and halo properties at a statistical level. We find that there is a clear enhancement (reduction) of substructure if the sign of the coupling is negative (positive) and that the dynamical state of the dark matter halos, particularly host halos, is undervirialised (overvirialised) at redshift zero when compared to uncoupled models or a reference $\Lambda$CDM simulation. Furthermore, positive coupling leads to less concentrated, less cuspy halos, whereas negative coupling leads to the opposite.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent advancements in small-scale observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have provided a unique opportunity to characterize the distribution of baryons in the outskirts of galaxies via stacking-based analyses of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich (kSZ) effect. Such measurements, mathematically equivalent to probing the galaxy-electron cross-correlation, have revealed that gas is more extended than dark matter and that the strength of baryonic feedback may vary with halo mass and redshift. However, because these analyses are conditioned on galaxy positions, the inferred electron distributions remain biased by uncertain galaxy-halo modeling on small scales. In this work, we present a novel kSZ$\times$galaxy four-point estimator that directly probes the full ionized electron field, extending beyond the gas traced by luminous galaxies. This method exploits large-scale velocity reconstruction from galaxy surveys to characterize the electron distribution unbiased by small-scale galaxy clustering. We forecast that the proposed signal can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim3$ ($\sim13$) for a configuration corresponding to Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 (Simons Observatory) CMB data combined with spectroscopic galaxy samples from DESI. This approach will enable the first tomographic measurements of the electron auto-power spectrum, providing new constraints on baryonic feedback and its role in shaping cosmic structure.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the effects of varying different Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback parameters on the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum (P1D). We use the Cosmological and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) suite to explore variations on the Simba simulation AGN feedback model. The parameters explored include AGN momentum flux, AGN jet speed, supermassive black hole (SMBH) radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass needed to produce jet feedback. Although all parameters affect the P1D, this work explores the radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass in this context for the first time and finds the following results: Primarily, the most massive SMBHs impact the Ly$\alpha$ forest through the jet feedback mode. While heating AGN jets to the virial temperature at injection aids in the removal of neutral hydrogen from the Ly$\alpha$ forest, this heating also inhibits further jet feedback. Similar behaviors are seen when varying the SMBH radiative efficiency, with higher values resulting in a suppression of SMBH growth and thus a later reduction in AGN feedback and lower values directly reducing the impact of AGN feedback on the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D. These results imply that increasing the AGN feedback strength in the Simba simulation model suppresses the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D, but only if the feedback does not impact the number of massive jet producing BHs. Future studies of AGN feedback models will require careful exploration of the unique aspects of the specific subgrid model, and how they interact with one another, for a complete understanding of the potential astrophysical impacts of SMBH feedback.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new cosmological analysis of the small-scale Lyman alpha forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D) using high-resolution quasar spectra from XQ100 and KODIAQ-SQUAD, interpreted through the PRIYA emulator. PRIYA is a suite of galaxy formation simulations spanning a range of cosmological and inhomogeneous HeII reionization parameters, enabling few-percent-level predictions of the P1D. These datasets, probing down to $k \sim 6\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z = 2-5$, offer access to non-linear scales inaccessible to large-volume surveys like eBOSS. We find that the XQ100 P1D yields constraints on the primordial power spectrum parameters $(A_P, n_P)$ at pivot scale $k_0 = 0.78\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ that are consistent with PRIYA results from eBOSS DR14 and Planck CMB, albeit with broader uncertainties. Notably, this is achieved without external IGM temperature data, showing that XQ100 alone provides stronger constraints on thermal history than eBOSS DR14. In contrast, the KODIAQ-SQUAD P1D favors a significantly higher $A_P$ value, driven by the selection bias toward high-column density absorbers (HCDs). We also find that the P1D at $k &gt; 0.045\,\mathrm{s/km}$ is more sensitive to Lyman limit system contamination and thermal history. When imposing a prior on $(A_P, n_P)$, the reduced $\chi^2$ remains unchanged and the inferred mean IGM temperature is unaffected, suggesting that cosmological and thermal parameters are largely sensitive to different scales. The XQ100 P1D therefore provides complementary information on thermal nuisance parameters, which can be jointly fit with eBOSS or DESI P1D measurements to improve cosmological constraints.</div>

We present a comprehensive evaluation of all terms contributing to this cross-correlation, including both the transverse and longitudinal modes of the density-weighted velocity field, as well as all irreducible correlators that contribute to the momentum power spectrum. This includes the dominant component, involving the convolution of the electron-galaxy and velocity-velocity power spectra, an additional disconnected cross-term, and a connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term. Using this framework, we examine the impact of other commonly neglected contributions, such as the two-halo component of the dominant term, and the impact of satellite galaxies. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming CMB experiments to these effects and determine that they will be sensitive to the cross-term, the connected non-Gaussian trispectrum term, the two-halo contribution and impact of satellite galaxies, at a significance level of $\sim 4-6 \sigma$. On the other hand, the contribution from longitudinal modes is negligible in all cases. These results identify the astrophysical observables that must be accurately modelled to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from near-future kSZ measurements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this study, we introduce SEDust, a pipeline designed to identify the best-fitting spectral energy distributions from the outputs of the DUSTY code and compare them to observational data. The pipeline incorporates a grid of 24000 models, enabling robust fitting for both carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars. It calculates key physical parameters, including luminosity, optical depth, and mass-loss rate, and produces the corresponding best-fit SED plots. Using SEDust, we derived the specific mass-return rates for the galaxies NGC 147 and NGC 185. The specific mass-return rate of AGB stars in NGC 147 is $8.13 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, while in NGC 185 it is $6.52 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These results indicate that the mass loss from evolved stars alone cannot account for the total mass budget required to sustain these galaxies, highlighting the need for additional sources or mechanisms of mass replenishment to resolve the observed discrepancies.</div>

We assemble the largest sample of 1646 galaxies with confirmed tidal features, finding a tidal feature fraction $f=0.06^{+0.05}_{-0.01}$. We analyse how the incidences of tidal features and the various classes of tidal features vary with host galaxy stellar mass, photometric redshift, and colour, as well as halo mass. We find an increasing relationship between tidal feature fraction and host galaxy stellar mass, and a decreasing relationship with redshift. We find more tidal features occurring in group environments with $12.014.1$) groups and clusters exhibit higher rates of tidal features than the satellite galaxies. We find good agreement between the trends we observe and the results obtained from purely visual or other automated methods, confirming the validity of our methodology and that using machine learning can drastically reduce the workload of visual classifiers, having needed to visually classify less than 30 per cent of our sample.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The past decade has transformed our ability to observe the Universe. Via gravitational waves, merging black holes and neutron stars can now be directly detected, offering unprecedented opportunities to test General Relativity and explore astrophysics in a new way. Driven by this breakthrough, the next generation of detectors is being developed to observe a wider range of sources with greater precision, ushering in a new era in gravitational-wave astronomy: leveraging black holes as probes of new physics. This thesis investigates how astrophysical environments, such as plasma, dark-matter structures, and clouds of ultralight bosons, affect black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures. After a short overview of gravitational-wave astrophysics, I study three classes of scenarios. (i) Isolated black holes: I examine boson clouds around black holes, their electromagnetic couplings and the role of surrounding plasma. (ii) Ringdown: I show that plasma can strongly modify the ringdown of charged black holes, whereas realistic dark-matter halos produce no detectable deviations even for next-generation detectors. (iii) Inspiral: for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with boson clouds, I find that orbital resonances typically destroy the cloud unless the orbit is nearly counter-rotating, yielding new and exciting observational signatures. Entering the relativistic regime, I develop a self-consistent perturbative framework to model generic environments in extreme-mass-ratio binaries and apply it to the boson-cloud case. Finally, I construct a model for binaries repeatedly crossing active galactic-nucleus disks and track their long-term orbital evolution. The results of this thesis show how black hole environments shape gravitational-wave signals and open avenues for testing new physics with future observatories such as LISA or the Einstein Telescope.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We implement an outlier detection model, an Isolation Foest (iForest), to uncover anomalous objects in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Fourth Data Release (GAMA DR4). The iForest algorithm is an unsupervise Machine Learning (ML) technique. The data used is the spectroscopic and photometric data from GAMA DR4, which compiless information for over 300000 objects. We select two samples of galaxies to isolate, high signal-to-noise galaxies, to analyse the iForest&#39;s robustness, and E+A galaxies, to study the extremes of their population. This results in six-subsamples of spectroscopic, photometric and combined data isolations, finding 101 anomalous objects, half of which have not been identified as outliers in other works. We also find a number of fringing errors and false emission lines, displaying the iForest&#39;s potential in detecting these errors. Finding anomalous E+A galaxies, that although selected in a normal manner, using low [OII] and strong H{\delta} absorption, are still star-forming, with strong H{\alpha} emission. We propose two solutions to why these E+A galaxies are still star-forming but also question if these galaxies can be truly classified as E+A galaxies. We suggest that small-scale interactions on the galaxies causes small star bursts. The radiative pressure when forming high mass stars form expels the accreting material quicker than it can be accreted. We also suggest that the Jeans limit in our anomalous E+A galaxies is so low that it is simply not possible to form O and B class stars, but not low enough to fully prevent star-formation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the propagating modes of New General Relativity (NGR) in second-order linear perturbations in the Lagrangian density (first-order in field equations). The Dirac-Bergmann analysis has revealed a violation of local Lorentz invariance in NGR. We review the recent status of NGR, considering the results of its Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We then reconsider the vierbein perturbation framework and identify the origin of each perturbation field in the vierbein field components. This identification is mandatory for adequately fixing gauges while guaranteeing consistency with the invariance guaranteed by the Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We find that the spatially flat gauge is adequate for analyzing a theory with the violation of local Lorentz invariance. Based on the established vierbein perturbative framework, introducing a real scalar field as a test matter, we perform a second-order perturbative analysis of NGR with respect to tensor, scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector and pseudo-vector modes. We reveal the possible propagating modes of each type of NGR. In particular, we find that Type 3 has stable five propagating modes, \textit{i.e.}, tensor, scalar, and vector modes, compared to five non-linear degrees of freedom, which results in its Dirac-Bergmann analysis; Type 3 is preferable for the application to cosmology. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to previous related work and conclude this study.</div>

The range of quenching times -- defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence -- found in this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between $1&lt;z&lt;3$. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics.

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering applications, given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these approaches, such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting low-fidelity models by leveraging available observations of the problem. However, the solely data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally requires dense observations that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study, we propose a physical loss term addition to the field inversion stage of the FIML technique similar to the physics-informed machine learning applications. This addition embeds the complex physics of the problem into the low-fidelity model, which allows for obtaining dense gradient information for every correction parameter and acts as an adaptive regularization term improving inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed Field Inversion approach is tested using three different examples and highlights that incorporating physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for limited data cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally, this modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an acceptable level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Studying phase transitions in interacting quantum field theories generally requires the numerical study of the dynamical system on an N-dimensional lattice, which is, in most cases, computationally quite the challenging task even with modern computing facilities. In this work I propose an alternative way to solve Euclidean path integrals in quantum field theories, using radial basis function-type neural networks, where the nonlinear part of the path integral is approximated by a linear combination of quadratic path integrals, therefore making the corresponding problem analytically tractable. The method allows us to calculate observables in a very efficient way, taking only seconds to do calculations that would otherwise take hours or even days with other existing methods. To test the capabilities of the model, it is used to describe the phase transition in the 1+1 dimensional interacting real scalar $\phi^4$ theory. The obtained phase transition line is compared to previous lattice results, giving very good agreement between them. The method is very flexible and could be extended to higher dimensions, finite temperatures, or even finite densities, therefore, it could give a very good alternative approach for solving numerically hard problems in quantum field theories.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The low-density region of the interstellar medium (ISM) where the Sun is located is known as the Local Bubble, a cavity filled with high-temperature and low-density plasma that may be created by a series of supernova (SN) explosions over the past 14 Myr. However, the effects of these SN explosions on the formation and evolution of the Local Bubble, as well as on nearby star formation, remain not fully understood. To study the expansion history of the Local Bubble, we use the kinematic data of the young stars obtained by cross-matching the pre-main-sequence (PMS) star catalog of \citet{Zari2018} with the high-precision astrometric and photometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 database. We perform a three-dimensional spatial clustering analysis on these young stars to identify star associations. We discover three unique star associations that exhibit a wiggle-like velocity pattern. The distances of these star associations are 108.5308, 141.5284, and 176.0318 pc, respectively. Their radial velocities in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) are 10.0622, 5.4982, and 9.0581 km/s, showing a pattern of decreasing and then increasing. This velocity pattern, as predicted by \citet{Krause&amp;Diehl2014}, is caused by a recent re-acceleration affected by the SN explosion, reinforcing the picture of the Local Bubble as an evolving entity.</div>

With order one CP violation in the dark sector, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can then be generated with branching fractions as small as $2.7 \times 10^{-8}$ for the exotic decay of $B$-mesons into baryons and missing energy. This sets a lower limit on the branching fraction below which Mesogenesis becomes disfavored. This work therefore strongly encourages collider searches to target sensitivities one to three orders of magnitude below planned limits.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A combination of JWST observations at z~12-14 and ALMA observations of extremely dust-rich systems at z~6 has demonstrated that dust grows extremely fast in the early Universe, with galaxies amassing up to 10^7 Msun of dust in just 500 Myr between z=12-&gt;6. In this paper we demonstrate, via a series of numerical experiments conducted in cosmological zoom-in simulations, that a likely pathway for this dust accumulation in the first formed galaxies is through production at early times via supernovae, followed by the rapid growth on ultrasmall dust grains. Our main results follow. The stellar production of dust dominates until z ~ 10-11 at which point galaxies transition to a growth-dominated regime. We employ a Shapley analysis to demonstrate that the local density is the dominant factor driving dust growth, followed by the grain size distribution. A rapid rise in the small-to-large grain ratio with decreasing redshift (owing to grain-grain shattering) drives growth through increased dust surface area per unit mass. Growth models are necessary to match the dust content of ALMA detected sources at z ~ 6. Finally, we demonstrate that ``blue monsters&#39;&#39;, massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$ with extremely blue continuum slopes likely have dust-to stellar mass ratios 10^-4-10^-3, but their top-heavy grain size distributions render them optically thin in the UV, providing a natural explanation for their observed properties without requiring exotic dust geometries.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z$\sim$2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new $\sim$30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O$^+$ and S$^{2+}$ ions. We find that n$_e$[O II] and n$_e$[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n$_e$ in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T$_e$[O II] and T$_e$[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T$_e$ scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)$=$7.76-8.78 (12-123% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T$_e$ measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O, in agreement with emerging results from other high-z studies and a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations underscore the need for exceptionally deep spectroscopy to unveil the ISM abundance patterns in high-z galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In Epoch 2 of the 2024 PDC25 Hypothetical Asteroid Impact Scenario, an asteroid is confirmed to be on a collision course with the Earth, and its size and surface composition have been well characterized via a flyby mission. A kinetic impactor deflection strategy is the most technologically mature path in order to mitigate this threat. Our goal is to constrain the possible range in momentum transfer coefficients, with implications for the number of impactors and the disruption risk. We conduct a series of numerical simulations, using a shock physics smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, in which we vary the impact velocity, cohesive properties and physical properties (mass / porosity) of the target asteroid. Given a judiciously chosen impactor mass, we show that the momentum transfer coefficient range is capable of a moderate-to-large enhancement of the asteroid deflection, yet keeps the disruption risk firmly at bay. These results are generally unique in having higher impact velocities compared to most previous studies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disk provides key constraints on models of galaxy evolution. However, studies using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers have been historically limited by large uncertainties in their distances. To overcome the long-standing distance uncertainties, we recalibrated the H$\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation (Frew et al. 2016) with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, deriving statistical distances for 1,200 PNe and Bayesian distances for 419 objects with reliable parallaxes. Adopting Bayesian values preferentially, we determined the O/H radial gradient for 230 disk PNe. We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit with one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection is statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near the solar radius ($R \sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient inward and a steeper negative gradient outward. This feature may reflect changes in star formation efficiency driven by the Galactic bar or the corotation resonance of the spiral arms. Comparison with other tracers - Cepheids, red giants, and open clusters - shows qualitative consistency. The two-dimensional O/H distribution in the Galactic plane supports the adopted distances and reveals modest azimuthal asymmetry, with enhanced abundances near the bar at positive longitudes, and a bimodal abundance structure between the inner and outer solar regions. Our results provide new constraints on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the impact of non-axisymmetric structures, and the possible existence of distinct radial abundance regimes across the Galactic disk.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The relation between metallicity and galaxy mass (the so-called mass-metallicity relation) is the strongest and most prominent among scaling relations between chemical enrichment and galactic properties. However, it is unclear whether this relation primarily traces metal retention or the integrated production of metals, as past studies have obtained contrasting results. We investigate this issue through an extensive Random Forest and Partial Correlations analysis of spectral cubes of 4,500 galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We find that stellar mass ($\rm M_*$) and baryonic gravitational potential ($\rm \Phi_* = M_*/R_e$) are the two most important quantities determining gas metallicity in galaxies. However, their relative roles strongly depend on the galactocentric radius -- the metallicity within 1~$\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the stellar mass, while the metallicity at radii beyond 1.5~$\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the gravitational potential. This finding can be interpreted in terms of metals in the central region ($\rm R\leq 1~R_e$) being mostly bound, regardless of the global gravitational potential and, therefore, the metallicity is determined primarily by the cumulative production of metals (hence the integrated star formation history, i.e. $\rm M_*$); by contrast, in the galactic peripheries the retention of metals depends more critically on the gravitational potential, hence the stronger dependence of the metallicity on $\rm \Phi_*$ at large radii. Our finding reconciles apparent discrepancies between previous results. Finally, we find that the Star Formation Rate is the third most important parameter (after $\rm M_*$ and $\rm \Phi_*$) in determining the metallicity, as expected from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Supernova (SN) 1987A is a celebrated laboratory in searches for gamma-ray flashes produced by the radiative decay of sub-GeV particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and novel gauge bosons. At large couplings, however, particles decay rapidly inside the stellar envelope, which results in a suppression of the signal. Focusing on the prototypical example of ALPs with a photon coupling, we show that core-collapse SNe of Type Ic are much less affected by this attenuation, thanks to the compactness of their progenitors ensuing from the loss of their envelope. While Fermi-LAT may miss the brief gamma-ray flash from a single Type Ic SN, their high rate allows for a statistical approach: by stacking many events, we can obtain constraints that significantly surpass those from SN 1987A at large couplings. Our approach can be extended to any feebly interacting particle featuring a decay channel into photons.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The cosmic dipole measured in surveys of cosmologically distant sources is generally found to be in disagreement with the kinematic expectation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This discrepancy represents severe tension with the Cosmological Principle and challenges the standard model of cosmology. Here, we present a Bayesian analysis of the tension between datasets used to measure the cosmic dipole. We examine the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer catalogue (CatWISE), and jointly analyse them with the Planck observations of the CMB. Under the kinematic interpretation, we find that Planck is in severe tension with CatWISE above 5$\sigma$, strong tension with RACS, and moderate tension with NVSS. Moreover, the strong concordance between CatWISE and NVSS suggests that their dipoles arise from a common astrophysical signal. Conversely, the high discordance between RACS and both CatWISE and NVSS indicates a possible systematic difference in the RACS catalogue itself. Whilst the tension between Planck and infrared-selected quasars is already significant, the question of whether or not the dipole in individual radio surveys adds to the challenge against the standard model is yet to be seen. We estimate that $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ radio sources are required to measure the tension to a significance of 5$\sigma$. Therefore, in light of the upcoming SKA radio surveys, we are on the cusp of disentangling the anomaly of the cosmic dipole.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gas-phase metallicity is a fundamental parameter that helps constrain the star-forming history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Measuring electron temperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to deriving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between metallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the photoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the discrepancies. We bin ~ 1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to metallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line calibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the flux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII], [OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the [NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to correct dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low ionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species and measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We present the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those model-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with the direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model, with a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results based on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice that the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization parameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the direct method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies between data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the one-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the complexity of real situations.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Astrophysical jets from powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) have recently been proposed as promising probes of dark matter (DM) in the sub-GeV mass range. AGN launch relativistic jets that accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energies, which can then interact with their surroundings and produce multiwavelength (MW) emission spanning from radio frequencies to TeV $\gamma$ rays. If DM consists of light particles, their interactions with CRs could lead to an additional cooling mechanism that modifies the expected MW emission. In this work, we analyse the MW spectrum of Markarian 421, a well-studied AGN, using a multizone leptonic jet model that includes the interactions between CR electrons and DM particles. For the first time, we account for the uncertainties in the astrophysical jet dynamics, which have been previously neglected when constraining the CR-DM interactions. By fitting simultaneously jet parameters and DM-electrons interactions, we use the MW data from Markarian 421 to set constraints on the DM-induced CR cooling. We obtain 5$\sigma$ upper limit $\sigma_\text{DM-e} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-34}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of $1~{\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that this is about a factor of five weaker than traditional approaches, implying that properly accounting for degeneracies between jet dynamics and DM interactions is key to derive robust constraints on DM interactions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way is hindered by stellar migration, which erases kinematic birth signatures. In contrast, stellar chemical abundances remain stable and can be used to trace stars back to their birth environments through chemical tagging. This study aims to improve chemical tagging by developing a method that leverages kinematic and age information to enhance clustering in chemical space, while remaining grounded in chemistry. We implement a graph attention auto-encoder that encodes stars as nodes with chemical features and connects them via edges based on orbital similarity and age. The network learns an ``informed&#39;&#39; chemical space that accentuates coherent groupings.Applied to $\sim$47,000 APOGEE thin disk stars, the method identifies 282 stellar groups. Among them, five out of six open clusters are successfully recovered. Other groups align with the known moving groups Arch/Hat, Sirius, Hyades, and Hercules. Our approach enables chemically grounded yet kinematically and age informed chemical tagging. It significantly improves the identification of coherent stellar populations, offering a framework for future large-scale stellar archaeology efforts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Kinematic information is crucial for understanding the evolution of complex systems, such as interstellar gas. Obtaining full 3D kinematic information is a crucial final step for modeling and interpretation. Molecular clouds are nurseries where stars are born. Stars at a very early stage, like young stellar objects (YSOs), inherit the spatial and kinematic structure of the gas patches they originate from. In this paper, we combine measurements of radial velocities towards the gas and the kinematic information of YSOs from Gaia DR3 to derive 3D velocities of a sample of YSO (Young Stellar Object)-MC (Molecular Cloud) complexes at d$\lesssim$3.5kpc from the Sun. We find that the molecular interstellar medium traced by the YSO-MC complexes generally follows Galactic rotation, with an additional peculiar velocity of 8.6 km s$^{-1}$. The random motion of these complexes in the Galactic XY plane is more energetic than motion along the Z direction. A catalogue containing the 3D velocities of the YSO-MC complexes at different reference frames is available, and the distances and 3D velocities of well-known molecular clouds are presented. Our results set the foundation for exploring the interplay between the Galaxy, the molecular ISM, and star formation. Data available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16364877.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Decay of a scalar condensate via interactions with (quasi-)particles is of interest to many fields in physics, including cosmology. In cosmology, the decay of an inflaton condensate leads to the production of daughter particles and reheating of the Universe. In computing the decay rate, two quantum field theoretic approaches can be found in the literature: one is based on parametric resonance of mode functions of the daughter particle; another is based on the $S$-matrix of a coherent state and Feynman-diagrammatic perturbation theory. We modify the latter from the previous literature in a way that manifests what we are computing and does not include unwanted Feynman diagrams. We notice the equivalence of these two approaches and demonstrate it by explicitly computing the decay rate at lower orders in the double expansion of the amplitude of coherent oscillation (or narrow resonance) and velocity of the daughter particle.</div>

However, this increase in performance comes with a significant increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length, and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The formation process of galaxy groups is not yet fully understood. In particular, that of fossil groups (FGs) is still under debate. Due to the relative rarity of FGs, large samples of such objects are still missing. The present paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary stages (FGs, &#34;almost&#34; FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG candidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten candidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We searched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to analyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software to the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar population properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous variation in properties is found between a group that is still building up (XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically complex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm two FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray luminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the substructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups. We also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity systems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of energy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster potential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to the large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs, near-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process of how fossil systems come into being in the Universe.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Atmospheric characterization of exoplanets has traditionally relied on Low-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (LRTS), obtained from both space- and ground-based facilities, as well as on High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (HRTS). Although HRTS can resolve individual spectral lines, it is subject to normalization degeneracies that limit the accurate retrieval of key atmospheric parameters such as pressure, abundance, and cloud opacity. A promising strategy to mitigate this issue is to combine ground-based HRTS with space-based LRTS. However, this approach depends on two separate datasets, thereby requiring two independent observations. In this study, we explore the feasibility of Multi-Object High-Resolution Transmission Spectroscopy (Mo-HRTS) as a means to constrain atmospheric parameters in retrievals using a single dataset. Through simulations based on existing spectrograph specifications for a well-studied target, we demonstrate that low-resolution broadband transmission spectra can be extracted from Mo-HRTS data.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The presence of molecular isomers in interstellar environments has become a topic of growing interest within the astrochemical community. Contrary to predictions based on thermodynamic equilibrium, recent observations reveal a diverse array of high-energy isomers and conformers. One of the most iconic molecular isomers detected in space, formic acid (HCOOH, FA), has been the focus of extensive theoretical research aimed at understanding its speciation into cis and trans conformers in dark clouds and photodissociation regions. In this work, we report the detection of c-FA, the higher-energy conformer, using ultrasensitive observations of TMC-1. This detection adds to previous findings in the Barnard-5 and L483 dark clouds. The derived trans-to-cis isomer ratio in TMC-1, 17.5, closely matches those observed in other sources, suggesting that the same chemical processes are at play across these environments. To investigate this, we conducted detailed astrochemical gas-grain models tailored to formic acid isomerism to explain the observed ratios. Our models successfully reproduce the observed trans/cis ratios and indicate that the presence of cis-formic acid can be attributed to the release of c-FA from grains, followed by isomerization driven by the excess energy released during the desorption process, a process that we name as isomerization upon desorption. The models also show that the isomerization of t-FA to c-FA in the gas phase is negligible at 10 K, meaning the observed ratios are a direct consequence of the formation pathways of both isomers on the surface of dust grains. However, at higher temperatures, quantum tunneling mediated direct isomerization in the gas becomes significant, and the ratios converge toward the thermodynamic equilibrium value.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.</div>

The experimental results demonstrate that, on average, UOT shows improvement over both Euclidean and OT-based methods as verified by statistical hypothesis tests.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Accurate proton dose calculation using Monte Carlo (MC) is computationally demanding in workflows like robust optimisation, adaptive replanning, and probabilistic inference, which require repeated evaluations. To address this, we develop a neural surrogate that integrates Monte Carlo dropout to provide fast, differentiable dose predictions along with voxelwise predictive uncertainty. The method is validated through a series of experiments, starting with a one-dimensional analytic benchmark that establishes accuracy, convergence, and variance decomposition. Two-dimensional bone-water phantoms, generated using TOPAS Geant4, demonstrate the method&#39;s behavior under domain heterogeneity and beam uncertainty, while a three-dimensional water phantom confirms scalability for volumetric dose prediction. Across these settings, we separate epistemic (model) from parametric (input) contributions, showing that epistemic variance increases under distribution shift, while parametric variance dominates at material boundaries. The approach achieves significant speedups over MC while retaining uncertainty information, making it suitable for integration into robust planning, adaptive workflows, and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We analyze a new class of static, smooth geometries in five-dimensional supergravity, dubbed $\mathcal{W}$-solitons. They carry the same mass and charges as four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\&#34;{o}m-like black holes but replace the horizon with a Kaluza-Klein bubble supported by electromagnetic flux. These solutions provide analytically tractable prototypes of black hole microstates in supergravity, including a new, astrophysically relevant neutral configuration involving a massless axion field. Focusing on photon scattering and scalar perturbations, we compute their key observables. We find that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons feature a single photon sphere, qualitatively similar to that of the black hole but with quantitative differences. They have only short-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs), as black holes, while long-lived echo modes seen in other ultracompact horizonless objects are absent. As a result, the ringdown closely resembles that of a black hole while still showing sizable deviations. The latter are at the ${\mathcal{O}}(10\%)$ level, compatible with the recent measurement of GW250114 and potentially falsifiable in the near future. Finally, we show that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons are stable under scalar perturbations. Our results underscore the qualitative similarities between $\mathcal{W}$-solitons and black holes, reinforcing their relevance as smooth black hole microstate prototypes.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an &#34;N-Plus-1&#34; GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet&#39;s Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and pedagogical value.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate dilepton production in a thermalized quark--gluon plasma subject to global rotation, in the rigid rotating approximation. We consider a generic process involving quark-antiquark annihilation, followed by the emission of a highly energetic virtual photon decaying into a dilepton pair. For this process, we compute the dilepton emission rate from the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor, at finite temperature and vorticity. Our results show that vorticity induces characteristic modifications in the light dilepton channel, namely $e^-e^+$ production, where the emission spectrum exhibits a suppression at low transverse mass together with a mild shift of the production threshold. This behavior originates from the role of vorticity as an effective spin-dependent chemical potential that alters the available phase-space distribution for the emission process. In contrast, the $\mu^-\mu^+$ channel is essentially insensitive to the rotational background, thus remaining dominated by its intrinsic mass threshold. The resulting channel dependence highlights a potential phenomenological handle for disentangling rotational effects in heavy-ion collisions: while light dilepton spectra encode the imprints of vorticity in the infrared sector, the muon channel provides a comparatively robust baseline.</div>

Vieyro</a><br><br>NGC 253 is a nearby starburst galaxy in the Sculptor group located at a distance of 3.5 Mpc that has been suggested by some authors as a potential site for cosmic-ray acceleration up to ultra-high energies. Its nuclear region is heavily obscured by gas and dust, which prevents establishing whether or not the galaxy harbours a supermassive black hole coexisting with the starburst. Some sources have been proposed in the literature as candidates for an active nucleus. In this work, we aim at determining the implications that the presence of a supermassive black hole at the nucleus of NGC 253 might have on cosmic ray acceleration. With this aim, we model the accretion flow on to the putative active nucleus, and we evaluate the feasibility of particle acceleration by the black hole dynamo mechanism. As a by-product, we explore the potential contribution from non-thermal particles in the accretion flow to the high-energy emission of the galaxy. We found that in the three most plausible nucleus candidates, the emission of the accretion flow would inhibit the black hole dynamo mechanism. To rule out completely the influence that a putative nucleus in NGC 253 might have in cosmic-ray acceleration, a better clarification concerning the true nature of the nucleus is needed. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09410">arXiv</a>,

This method enables testing the theory of gravity by combining the effects from both gravitational lensing of gravitational waves and the propagation of gravitational waves in spacetime. We find that within 10 years, the combination of the Advanced-LIGO and VIRGO detector networks with planned galaxy surveys should detect weak gravitational lensing of gravitational waves in the low redshift Universe ($z&lt;0.5$). With the next generation gravitational wave experiments such as Voyager, LISA, Cosmic-Explorer and Einstein Telescope, we can extend this test of the theory of gravity to larger redshifts by exploiting the synergies between electromagnetic wave and gravitational wave probes. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08951">arXiv</a>,

Here, the pion dPDFs are investigated within holographic QCD inspired quark models in order to access their basic features. Dynamical information obtained within the AdS/QCD soft-wall approach, also including further improvements, have been compared with predictions of lattice QCD calculations of the pion two-current correlation functions. The present analysis confirms that double parton correlations, affecting dPDFs, are very important and not direct accessible from generalised parton distribution functions and electromagnetic form factors. The comparison between lattice data and quark model calculations unveils the relevance of the contributions of high partonic Fock states in the pion. Nevertheless, by using a complete general procedure, results of lattice QCD have been used, for the first time, to estimate the mean value of the so called $\sigma_{eff}$, an experimental observable, relevant for DPS processes. In addition, the results of a first study of the dPDFs of the $\rho$ meson are discussed in order to make predictions. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09400">arXiv</a>,

Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) absorption is detected at the redshift of UGC 5282 with $\log$[$N$(HI) cm$^{-2}\:$] = 20.89$^{+0.12}_{-0.21}\:\:$. Analysis of the accompanying SII, PII and OI metal lines yields a neutral gas metallicity $Z_{HI}$ of [S/H] $\simeq$ [P/H] $= -0.80\pm0.24$. The metallicity of ionized gas from the central HII region, $Z_{HII}\:$, measured from its emission lines is [O/H]$= -0.37\pm0.10$, a difference of $+0.43\pm 0.26$ from $Z_{HI}\:$. This difference $\delta$ is consistent with that seen towards HII regions in other star-forming galaxies and supports the idea that ionized gas near star forming regions show systematically higher metallicities than exist in the rest of a galaxy's neutral interstellar medium (ISM). The positive values of $\delta$ found in UGC 5282 (and the other star forming galaxies) is likely due to infalling low metallicity gas from the intergalactic medium which mixes with the galaxy's ISM on kpc scales. This model is also consistent with broad Ly$\alpha$ emission detected at the bottom of the DLA absorption, offset by $\sim 125$ km s$^{-1}$ from the absorption velocity. Models of galaxy evolution which attempt to replicate population characteristics, such as the mass-metallicity relation, may need to start with a galaxy metallicity represented by $Z_{HI}$ rather than that measured traditionally from $Z_{HII}\:$. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06429">arXiv</a>,

Davidge</a><br><br>We discuss near-infrared (NIR) slit spectra of six early-type disk galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. While the depth of the CO(2,0) band is consistent with the centers of these galaxies having solar or slightly sub-solar luminosity-weighted metallicities, galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the depth of the NaI 2.21um doublet are found, with NaI2.21um lines in three galaxies (NGC 4491, NGC 4584, and NGC 4620) that are deeper than those predicted for a solar chemical mixture and a solar-neighborhood mass function. Considering the depth of the NaD lines found by Davidge (2018a), the deep NaI2.21um lines are tentatively attributed to a bottom-heavy mass function. This is counter to observed trends between mass function slope and velocity dispersion. Two of the three galaxies with deep NaI2.21um (NGC 4584 and NGC 4620) have Sersic exponents that are consistent with a classical bulge. As for NGC 4491, its central NIR spectrum contains prominent emission lines. The relative strengths of Brgamma and H_2S(1), the presence of [FeII] emission, and the mid-infrared spectral-energy distribution are all consistent with intense recent star formation near the center of that galaxy. Wavelengths that contain the Ballick-Ramsey C_2 band at 1.76um are matched by moderately metal-poor E-MILES model spectra with an age of 2 Gyr. It is concluded that these galaxies have evolved in a cluster environment for at least several Gyr. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09357">arXiv</a>,

Gelowitz</a><br><br>The X-ray emission from a supernova remnant (SNR) is a powerful diagnostic of the state of the shocked plasma. The temperature (kT) and the emission measure (EM) of the shocked-gas are related to the energy of the explosion, the age of the SNR, and the density of the surrounding medium. Progress in X-ray observations of SNRs has resulted in a significant sample of Galactic SNRs with measured kT and EM values. We apply spherically symmetric SNR evolution models to a new set of 43 SNRs to estimate ages, explosion energies, and circumstellar medium densities. The distribution of ages yields a SNR birth rate. The energies and densities are well fit with log-normal distributions, with wide dispersions. SNRs with two emission components are used to distinguish between SNR models with uniform ISM and with stellar wind environment. We find type Ia SNRs to be consistent with a stellar wind environment. Inclusion of stellar wind SNR models has a significant effect on estimated lifetimes and explosion energies of SNRs. This reduces the discrepancy between the estimated SNR birthrate and the SN rate of the Galaxy. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08998">arXiv</a>,

Several ground-based experiments are either underway or are being planned for mapping wide areas of the sky at $\sim 150$ GHz with large-aperture telescopes. We present cosmological forecasts for a 'straw man' tSZ survey that will observe a sky area between $200$ and $10^4$ deg$^2$ to an rms noise level between 2.8 and 20.2 $\mu$K-arcmin. The probes we consider are the cluster number counts (as a function of the integrated Compton-$Y$ parameter and redshift) and their angular clustering (as a function of redshift). At fixed observing time, we find that wider surveys constrain cosmology slightly better than deeper ones due to their increased ability to detect rare high-mass clusters. In all cases, we notice that adding the clustering information does not practically improve the constraints derived from the number counts. We compare forecasts obtained by sampling the posterior distribution with the Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo method against those derived using the Fisher-matrix formalism. We find that the latter produces slightly optimistic constraints where errors are underestimated at the 10 per cent level. Most importantly, we use an analytic method to estimate the selection function of the survey and account for its response to variations of the cosmological parameters in the likelihood function. Our analysis demonstrates that neglecting this effect (as routinely done in the literature) yields artificially tighter constraints by a factor of 2.2 and 1.7 for $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{M}$, respectively. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09069">arXiv</a>,

David Neelin</a> (AOS)<br><br>A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential systems is presented. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived. These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale separation is weak.The companions articles, Part II and Part III, deal with further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for providing an unambiguous "signature" of nonlinear oscillations embedded within a stochastic background. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances presented in this contribution, Part III addresses the question of detection and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic system, namely the Cane-Zebiak model of El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation subject to noise modeling fast atmospheric fluctuations. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03170">arXiv</a>,

Recently we showed a time like dynamical vector field which is coupled non-minimally with scalar tensor Brans-Dicke gravity has a modified Schwarzschild de Sitter metric solution in weak field limit. In fact physical effects of the preferred reference frames make an effective cosmological parameter. AdS regime (negative cosmological constant) of this metric solution is used to obtain lensing potential because with this condition the metric solution reaches to Minkowski form at an important local position. To do so we apply Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory of a massless scalar field instead of the vector electromagnetic waves in absence of the polarization property of the EM waves. This is done to obtain corrections on location of the images formed by a point like source in wave optics. Our main goal in this work is study effects of the effective negative cosmological parameter on the interference fringes of the diffracted waves, position of the formed images, distance between the formed images and their intensity. We get methodology proposed by Nambu et al to write this paper. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09218">arXiv</a>,

Saiyad Ali</a><br><br>Measurements of the Galactic synchrotron emission is relevant for the 21-cm studies from the Epoch of Reionization. The study of the synchrotron emission is also useful to quantify the fluctuations in the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. Here, we present the all-sky angular power spectrum $(C_{\ell})$ measurements of the diffuse synchrotron emission using the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS) at 150 {\rm MHz}. We estimate $C_{\ell}$ using visibility data both before and after subtracting the modelled point sources. The amplitude of the measured $C_{\ell}$ falls significantly after subtracting the point sources, and it is also slightly higher in the Galactic plane for the residual data. The residual $C_{\ell}$ is most likely to be dominated by the Galactic synchrotron emission. The amplitude of the residual $C_{\ell}$ falls significantly away from the Galactic plane. We find the measurements are quite symmetric in the Northern and Southern hemispheres except in the latitude range $15-30^{\circ}$ which is the transition region from the disk dominated to diffuse halo dominated region. The comparison between this interferometric measurement with the scaled version of the Haslam rms map at 150 {\rm MHz} shows that the correlation coefficient $(r)$ is more than 0.5 for most of the latitude ranges considered here. This signifies the TGSS survey is quite sensitive to the diffuse Galactic synchrotron radiation. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07869">arXiv</a>,

We estimate the fraction of very young galaxies (VYGs), defined as those with more than half their stellar masses formed within the last Gyr. We fit non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs) to ~280 000 galaxy spectra from a flux- and volume-limited subsample of the Main Galaxy Sample (MGS) of the SDSS, which is also complete in mass-to-light ratio, thus properly accounting for passive galaxies of a given mass. The VYG fractions decrease with increasing galaxy stellar mass, from ~50% at $m = 10^8\,\rm M_\odot$ to ~0.1% at $m = 10^{11.5}\,\rm M_\odot$, with differences of up to 1 dex between the different spectral models used to estimate the SFH and on how we treat aperture effects. But old stellar populations may hide in our VYGs despite our conservative VYG sample built with galaxies that are globally bluer than within the region viewed by the SDSS fibre. The VYG fractions versus mass decrease more gradually compared to the Tweed et al. predictions using analytical and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, but agree better with the SIMBA hydrodynamical simulation. These discrepancies highlight the usefulness of VYGs in constraining the strong uncertainties in both galaxy formation models and spectral modelling of galaxy SFHs. Given the lognormal cosmic SFH, these mean VYG fractions suggest that galaxies with $m &gt; 10^8\,\rm M_\odot$ undergo at most 4 major starbursts on average. <br><br>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06522">arXiv</a>,

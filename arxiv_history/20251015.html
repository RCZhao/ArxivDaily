                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extracting cosmological information from the Euclid galaxy survey will require modelling numerous systematic effects during the inference process. This implies varying a large number of nuisance parameters, which have to be marginalised over before reporting the constraints on the cosmological parameters. This is a delicate process, especially with such a large parameter space, which could result in biased cosmological results. In this work, we study the impact of different choices for modelling systematic effects and prior distribution of nuisance parameters for the final Euclid Data Release, focusing on the 3$\times$2pt analysis for photometric probes and the galaxy power spectrum multipoles for the spectroscopic probes. We explore the effect of intrinsic alignments, linear galaxy bias, magnification bias, multiplicative cosmic shear bias and shifts in the redshift distribution for the photometric probes, as well as the purity of the spectroscopic sample. We find that intrinsic alignment modelling has the most severe impact with a bias up to $6\,\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$ if neglected, followed by mis-modelling of the redshift evolution of galaxy bias, yielding up to $1.5\,\sigma$ on the parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{{\rm m}} /0.3}$. Choosing a too optimistic prior for multiplicative bias can also result in biases of the order of $0.7\,\sigma$ on $S_8$. We also find that the precision on the estimate of the purity of the spectroscopic sample will be an important driver for the constraining power of the galaxy clustering full-shape analysis. These results will help prioritise efforts to improve the modelling and calibration of systematic effects in Euclid.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We report the discovery of three Milky Way satellite candidates: Carina IV, Phoenix III, and DELVE 7, in the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE). The candidate systems were identified by cross-matching results from two independent search algorithms. All three are extremely faint systems composed of old, metal-poor stellar populations ($\tau \gtrsim 10$ Gyr, [Fe/H] $ \lesssim -1.4$). Carina IV ($M_V = -2.8;\ r_{1/2} = 40 {\rm pc}$) and Phoenix III ($M_V = -1.2;\ r_{1/2} = 19 {\rm pc}$) have half-light radii that are consistent with the known population of dwarf galaxies, while DELVE 7 ($M_V = 1.2;\ r_{1/2} = 2 {\rm pc}$) is very compact and seems more likely to be a star cluster, though its nature remains ambiguous without spectroscopic followup. The Gaia proper motions of stars in Carina IV ($M_* = 2250^{+1180}_{-830} {\rm M_\odot}$) indicate that it is unlikely to be associated with the LMC, while DECam CaHK photometry confirms that its member stars are metal-poor. Phoenix III ($M_* = 520^{+660}_{-290} {\rm M_\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite in the extreme outer stellar halo ($D_{\rm GC} &gt; 100$ kpc), while DELVE 7 ($M_* = 60^{+120}_{-40} {\rm M_\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite with $D_{\rm GC} &gt; 20$ kpc.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\Psi+\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\delta_m$, capsulized as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, together with the possible spatial and temporal variation, is essential in probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the lack of an unbiased proxy of $\delta_m$ prohibits direct measurement of $G_{\rm light}$. We point out that the equivalence principle ensures the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy of $\delta_m$. We further propose a FRB-based method $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. The measurement, with a conservative cut $k\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, can achieve a precision of $\lesssim 10\% \sqrt{10^5/N_{\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, is subdominant ($\sim 5\%$). It can be further mitigated to the $\lesssim 1\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the bias of total baryonic matter (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning over 20 orders of magnitude.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity mapping power spectrum from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). We measure the cross-power spectrum of the Ly$\alpha$ intensity and Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) in a redshift range of $1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. We calculate the intensity from HETDEX spectra that do not contain any detected LAEs above a signal-to-noise ratio of $5.5$. To produce a power spectrum model and its covariance matrix, we simulate the data using lognormal mocks for the LAE catalog and Ly$\alpha$ intensity in redshift space. The simulations include the HETDEX sensitivity, selection function, and mask. The measurements yield the product of the LAE bias, the intensity bias, the mean intensity of undetected sources, and the ratio of the actual and fiducial redshift-space distortion parameters, $b_\mathrm{g} b_I \langle I \rangle \bar{F}_{\rm RSD} / \bar{F}^{\rm fid}_{\rm RSD}= (6.7 \pm 3.1)$, $(11.7 \pm 1.4)$, and $(8.3 \pm 1.5) \times 10^{-22} \, \text{erg}\, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{arcsec}^{-2} \, \text{{\AA}}^{-1}$ in three redshift bins centered at $\bar z=2.1$, 2.6, and 3.2, respectively. The results are reasonably consistent with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer. They are, however, significantly smaller than previous results from cross-correlations of quasars with Ly$\alpha$ intensity. These results demonstrate the statistical power of HETDEX for Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping and pave the way for a more comprehensive analysis. They will also be useful for constraining models of Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies used in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\lambda$~4 $\mu$m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The scattering transform is a wavelet-based statistic capable of capturing non-Gaussian features in weak lensing (WL) convergence maps and has been proven to tighten cosmological parameter constraints by accessing information beyond two-point functions. However, its application in cosmological inference requires a clear understanding of its sensitivity to astrophysical systematics, the most significant of which are baryonic effects. These processes substantially modify the matter distribution on small to intermediate scales ($k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), leaving scale-dependent imprints on the WL convergence field. We systematically examine the impact of baryonic feedback on scattering coefficients using full-sky WL convergence maps with Stage IV survey characteristics, generated from the FLAMINGO simulation suite. These simulations include a broad range of feedback models, calibrated to match the observed cluster gas fraction and galaxy stellar mass function, including systematically shifted variations, and incorporating either thermal or jet-mode AGN feedback. We characterise baryonic effects using a baryonic transfer function defined as the ratio of hydrodynamical to dark-matter-only scattering coefficients. While the coefficients themselves are sensitive to both cosmology and feedback, the transfer function remains largely insensitive to cosmology and shows a strong response to feedback, with suppression reaching up to $10\%$ on scales of $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that shape noise significantly diminishes the sensitivity of the scattering coefficients to baryonic effects, reducing the suppression from $\sim 2 - 10 \;\%$ to $\sim 1\;\%$, even with 1.5 arcmin Gaussian smoothing. This highlights the need for noise mitigation strategies and high-resolution data in future WL surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper presents a systematic literature review focusing on the application of machine learning techniques for deriving observational constraints in cosmology. The goal is to evaluate and synthesize existing research to identify effective methodologies, highlight gaps, and propose future research directions. Our review identifies several key findings: (1) various machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian processes, and deep learning models, have been applied to cosmological data analysis, improving parameter estimation and handling large datasets. However, models achieving significant computational speedups often exhibit worse confidence regions compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance both efficiency and measurement precision. (2) Traditional cosmological methods, such as those using Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data, remain fundamental, but most studies focus narrowly on specific datasets. We recommend broader dataset usage to fully validate alternative cosmological models. (3) The reviewed studies mainly address the $H_0$ tension, leaving other cosmological challenges-such as the cosmological constant problem, warm dark matter, phantom dark energy, and others-unexplored. (4) Hybrid methodologies combining machine learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo offer promising results, particularly when machine learning techniques are used to solve differential equations, such as Einstein Boltzmann solvers, as prior to Markov chain Monte Carlo models, accelerating computations while maintaining precision. (5) There is a significant need for standardized evaluation criteria and methodologies, as variability in training processes and experimental setups complicates result comparability and reproducibility (abridged).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The local Hubble flow offers a powerful laboratory to study the interplay between cosmic expansion and gravitational dynamics. On large scales, galaxy velocities follow Hubble&#39;s law, but within groups and clusters local gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio $M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters around $H_0 = 64 \pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74. This corresponds to an average 25\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Scattering between dark matter (DM) and protons leads to suppressed small-scale fluctuations, with implications for a variety of cosmological observables. In this work, we search for evidence of DM-proton scattering with an interaction cross section $\sigma\!=\!\sigma_0 (\frac{v}{c})^n$ for $n=0,2$ and $4$, corresponding e.g. to velocity-independent contact interactions from heavy mediators, velocity-dependent pseudoscalar-mediated scattering, and higher-order dipole interactions, respectively, using high-redshift ($z \sim4-10$) ultraviolet galaxy luminosity functions (UVLFs) observed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We employ an adjusted implementation of GALLUMI combined with the modified Boltzmann solver CLASS DMeff that accounts for interacting DM, and incorporate UVLF data from both blank and lensed HST fields, alongside Planck CMB data and the Pantheon supernova catalog in a Bayesian analysis framework to set constraints on $\sigma_0$. Our results show that including lensed UVLF data, which probe fainter galaxies than the blank HST fields and thus smaller scales, leads to a substantial improvement in the constraints on $\sigma_0$ for $n&gt;0$, surpassing existing bounds from Milky-Way (MW) satellite abundance and CMB anisotropies. For $m_{\chi} = 1\,\rm MeV $, for example, we set the upper bounds at $8.3\times 10^{-26} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=2$ and $1.2\times 10^{-22} \, \rm cm^2$ for $n=4$. For $n=0$, our bound is within an order of magnitude of those from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and MW satellites.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress, with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep learning research.</div>

The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 indicate that dark energy may be a dynamical quantity with a time-varying equation of state. This challenges the core assumptions of the $\Lambda$CDM model and has generated significant interest in dynamical dark energy models. Therefore, studying the parameterization of the equation of state for dynamical dark energy is crucial. Existing work has achieved fruitful results in the dark energy models, exploring various parameterization forms, but it is relatively scattered and lacks systematic parameter constraints based on the latest dataset combinations. We use the $\Lambda$CDM as a baseline model and carry out rigorous statistical constraints on key cosmological parameters for seven representative parameterization models. Planck PR4 and DESI DR2 observations are incorporated into our study. We use three dataset combinations: CMB+BAO+PantheonPlus, CMB+BAO+DES-Y5, and CMB+BAO+Union3. The ${H}_{0}$ and ${\sigma }_{8}$ values of all dynamical dark energy models are lower than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating that our results may not effectively alleviate ${H}_{0}$ tension, but can significantly reduce ${\sigma }_{8}$ tension. By comparing the $\chi^2$ and the Akaike Information Criterion obtained for each model, we demonstrate that the linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization model is not the optimal choice in all cases. Specifically, when combined with the CMB+BAO+DES-Y5 dataset, the Barboza-Alcaniz, Logarithmic, and Exponential models demonstrate superior statistical fitting performance compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The Barboza-Alcaniz model shows a great advantage in fitting performance, leading to the most significant improvement.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study explores the possibility of a time-varying dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) deviating from -1. We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad&#39;e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad&#39;e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad&#39;e-I, SPad&#39;e-I, Pad&#39;e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad&#39;e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad&#39;e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\sigma} and 6.4{\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\sigma} and 5.1{\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad&#39;e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The development of an N-body/hydrodynamic `surrogate&#39; model of the Milky Way (MW) - a model that resembles the MW in several key aspects after many Gyrs of evolution - would be extremely beneficial for Galactic Archaeology. Here we present four new `surrogate&#39; models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve&#39; - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible ways forward for future models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Milky Way is known to contain a stellar bar, as are a significant fraction of disc galaxies across the universe. Our understanding of bar evolution, both theoretically and through analysis of simulations indicates that bars both grow in amplitude and slow down over time through interaction and angular momentum exchange with the galaxy&#39;s dark matter halo. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying this coupling requires modelling of the structural deformations to the potential that are mutually induced between components. In this work we use Basis Function Expansion (BFE) in combination with multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis (mSSA) as a non-parametric analysis tool to illustrate the coupling between the bar and the dark halo in a single high-resolution isolated barred disc galaxy simulation. We demonstrate the power of mSSA to extract and quantify explicitly coupled dynamical modes, determining growth rates, pattern speeds and phase lags for different stages of evolution of the stellar bar and the dark matter response. BFE &amp; mSSA together grant us the ability to explore the importance and physical mechanisms of bar-halo coupling, and other dynamically coupled structures across a wide range of dynamical environments.</div>

Of the 132 Lorentz-violating degrees of freedom that are observable in this limit, 43 remain unconstrained. In this work, we demonstrate how existing experiments and data sets can be used to generate relevant sensitivities to all of these remaining degrees of freedom. We extract limits on all 43 of the previously unconstrained degrees of freedom and make additional improvements on 13 existing limits using published data. Our methods also offer the potential of improvements for 49 degrees of freedom in suitable future experiments.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature, existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error, enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in transfer learning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an algorithm designed to identify galaxy (proto)clusters in wide-area photometric surveys by first selecting their dominant galaxy-i.e., the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) or protoBCG-through the local stellar mass density traced by massive galaxies. We focus on its application to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Wide Survey to detect candidates up to $\rm z \sim 2$. In this work, we apply the method to mock galaxy catalogs that replicate the observational constraints of the HSC-SSP Wide Survey. We derive functions that describe the probability of a massive galaxy being the dominant galaxy in a structure as a function of its stellar mass density contrast within a given redshift interval. We show that galaxies with probabilities greater than 50\% yield a sample of BCGs/protoBCGs with $\gtrsim 65\%$ purity, where most of the contamination arises from galaxies in massive groups below our cluster threshold. Using the same threshold, the resulting (proto)cluster sample achieves 80\% purity and 50\% completeness for halos with $M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14} \ M_{\odot}$, reaching nearly 100\% completeness for $M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14.5} \ M_{\odot}$. We also assign probabilistic membership to surrounding galaxies based on stellar mass and distance to the dominant galaxy, from which we define the cluster richness as the number of galaxies more likely to be true members than contaminants. This allows us to derive a halo mass-richness relation. In a companion paper, we apply the algorithm to the HSC-SSP data and compare our catalog with others based on different cluster-finding techniques and X-ray detections.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions, rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in safety-critical applications.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">JWST has enabled the discovery of a statistical sample of obscured (type II) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at cosmic noon. Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host&#39;s spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.</div>

STC provides both asymptotic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations for computing the exact statistical significance of a discovery or for setting upper limits on signal model parameters. We review the underlying statistical formalism, including profile likelihood ratio test statistics for discovery and exclusion hypotheses, and the asymptotic distributions that allow quick significance estimates. We explain the relevant formulas for the likelihood functions, test statistic distributions, and significance metrics (both with and without incorporating systematic uncertainties). The implementation and capabilities of STC are described, and we validate its performance against the widely-used CMS Combine tool. We find excellent agreement in both the expected discovery significances and upper limit calculations. STC is a flexible framework that can accommodate systematic uncertainties and user-defined statistical models, making it suitable for a broad range of analyses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance, often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy, performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem. As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii) truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.</div>

Building on recent studies in single-top + DM topologies, we extend the research to $t\bar{t}$ + DM final states. Inputs to our networks combine low-level four-momenta and missing transverse energy with high-level kinematic and angular variables. We compare a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor, an autoregressive flow, and the conditional $\nu$-Flows model -- trained to learn the full conditional density. In these final states all the models perform well and demonstrate high reconstruction quality in independent regions split by $m_{t\bar{t}}$ for validation purposes. We highlight the potential of this approach to be extended to three- and four-top-quark production.</div>

This paper unifies and extends many previous optimization-based approaches to constrained confidence region construction in linear inverse problems through the lens of statistical test inversion. We begin by reviewing the historical development of optimization-based confidence intervals for the single-functional setting, from &#34;strict bounds&#34; to the Burrus conjecture and its recent refutation via the aforementioned test inversion framework. We then extend this framework to the multiple-functional setting. This framework can be used to: (i) improve the calibration constants of previous methods, yielding smaller confidence regions that still preserve frequentist coverage, (ii) obtain tractable multidimensional confidence regions that need not be hyper-rectangles to better capture functional dependence structure, and (iii) generalize beyond Gaussian error distributions to generic log-concave error distributions. We provide theory establishing nominal simultaneous coverage of our methods and show quantitative volume improvements relative to prior approaches using numerical experiments.</div>

This null test can also be performed using a joint dataset of DESI BAO and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) observations. Additionally, we use the test to assess the internal consistency and mutual compatibility of these datasets. We find that the data are compatible. Although the results show that a spatially flat universe is inconsistent with the data at low redshift $z\lesssim 0.5$, we cannot draw the conclusion that the observational data prefers $\Omega_k\neq 0$ because there is no observational data in that region.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the past few decades, the waveform community has made advances in producing waveforms that span the inspiral-merger-ringdown of comparable-mass-ratio black hole binaries using advances in post-Newtonian and numerical relativity (NR) theory along with state-of-the-art gravitational wave models. Current methods in NR have shown progress towards producing stable simulations reaching mass ratios of 1:100; however, the computational cost becomes prohibitively expensive as the mass ratio and the length of the simulation increases. Meanwhile, the gravitational self-force (GSF) community has developed waveform models that not only generate extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, but also generate near-equal-mass-ratio waveforms with high fidelity. To assess the limits of both the GSF and NR waveforms and alleviate the computational costs of NR, we present hybridized GSF-NR waveforms for non-spinning binary black hole systems in which GSF provides the inspiral, and NR the merger and ringdown. The hybrid waveforms are generated from a set of 68 non-spinning NR waveforms from the SXS catalogue with mass ratios spanning 1:1 to 1:20 and include the (2,2), (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4), (4,3), and (5,5) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. In this paper, we will highlight a selection of these hybrid waveforms and examine the error in the hybridization procedure. We will investigate the impact of subdominant modes on the accuracy of the hybrid waveforms by performing mismatch comparisons with surrogate models. To address the feasibility of hybridizing GSF inspirals with short, high-mass ratio NR waveforms, thereby alleviating computational costs, we will discuss the relationship between mass ratio and the placement of the matching window, which can be used to predict the necessary and optimal number of NR cycles that contribute to the hybrid waveform.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding how the Milky Way&#39;s present-day structure was shaped by past major mergers is a key goal of Galactic archaeology. The chemical and dynamical structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that stars born in the progenitor&#39;s core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\&#39;ulad\&#39;ottir et al. (2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context. The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar, though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported by Sk\&#39;ulad\&#39;ottir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of accreted stars.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language - has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We explore the structure of the parameter space in the Singlet Scalar Dark Matter (SSDM) model and the Next-to-Two Higgs Doublet Model (N2HDM) with $\tan\beta = 5$ and $\tan\beta = 45$. Parameter points are classified as allowed or excluded based on compatibility with the Higgs observation constraints. Using a combined framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we characterize the global geometry and topology of these high-dimensional landscapes. Our findings reveal that the SSDM and the N2HDM Type~I model exhibit finely tuned islands of collider viability. In the case of N2HDM Type~I, we also find that increasing $\tan\beta$ leads to greater topological fragmentation and higher Betti number persistence, indicating enhanced structural complexity. In contrast, the given choice of parameters excludes the entire N2HDM Type II parameter space based on current Higgs measurements. The topological properties serve as important quantitative descriptors for the phenomenological viability of the BSM frameworks. We leverage the above mentioned topological features to train machine learning models for faster characterization of the BSM Higgs sector into allowed and excluded parameter regions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The precision of cluster parameter determination has significantly improved with the availability of homogeneous photometric Gaia data, however, challenges such as age-metallicity degeneracy and lack of spectroscopic observations remain. In this paper we investigate whether metallicities derived from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra can be effectively used to break degeneracies and improve the accuracy of OC parameter determinations. We analysed 20 OCs using isochrone fitting methods on Gaia DR3 photometry and metallicity estimates from several Gaia XP-based catalogues. We derived age, distance modulus, and extinction using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). We compared the parameter estimates to the values obtained in other works through isochrone fitting with spectroscopically constrained metallicities or through neural network techniques applied only to the photometry. We found the systematic difference between Gaia XP derived metallicities and those obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to be 0.1-0.15 dex. We found a systematic age difference of &lt;0.03 +- 0.13 dex compared to isochrone fitting using high-resolution spectroscopy, and &lt;0.08 +- 0.21 dex compared to neural network-based methods, and a median individual error of ~0.065 dex. Despite their low resolution, Gaia XP metallicities effectively constrain parameters of clusters lacking a well-populated RGB. When used with stringent quality cuts and incorporated as priors, they allow to determine ages comparable in precision to those based on high-resolution spectroscopy and more precise than photometry-only neural network methods. These results highlight the potential of Gaia data for accurate cluster parameter analysis and detailed Galactic studies without relying on traditional spectroscopy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate the three challenges simultaneously.</div>

For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 Msun/yr and kinetic powers $\sim$ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H$\alpha$). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with $\dot{M_{out}}-L_{AGN}$ scaling relations across 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with $L_{AGN} \geq 10^{43}$ erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The correlations between the positions and shapes of galaxies, i.e. intrinsic alignments, have been measured in many observational studies and hydrodynamical simulations. The alignments of disk galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations have been measured to be positive, null and negative with varying methodologies, samples and hydrodynamical simulations. This work compares the correlations of disks and ellipticals around all galaxies and disks around ellipticals at $z=0$ and $z=1$ for simple and reduced shapes in TNG300, Horizon-AGN and EAGLE for multiple morphological definitions in a consistent way. All types of signals are positive and robust in TNG300 and EAGLE and positive or null in Horizon-AGN, except for the disks around ellipticals correlation for reduced shapes at $z=1$ when defined by $|v/\sigma|$, which is negative. A re-weighting of the ellipticals around galaxies signals in TNG300, according to the underlying stellar mass distributions of the samples, highlights the importance of the influence of (sub-grid) physics at these non-linear scales.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We consider the implications of the modified dispersion relations, due to the noncommutativity of the spacetime, for a photon gas filling the early Universe in the framework of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) processes, during the period of light elements formation. We consider three types of deformations present in the dispersion relations for the radiation gas, from which we obtain the low temperature corrections to the energy density and pressure. The cosmological implications of the modified equations of state in the BBN era are explored in detail for all radiation models. The effects induced on the nucleosynthesis process by spacetime noncommutativity are investigated by evaluating the abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). The primordial mass fraction estimates and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature impose an upper limit on the energy density of the deformed photon gas, which follows from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviations from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma are therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Upper limits on the free parameters of the spacetime noncommutativity are obtained via a numerical analysis performed using the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package. The primordial abundances of the light elements are obtained by evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rates for the considered noncommutative spacetime models. An MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis allows to obtain restrictions on the free parameters of the modified dispersion relations. The numerical and statistical approach is implemented in the python code \texttt{PRyNCe}, available on GitHub.</div>

This is because it is the physical black holes formed through gravitational collapse serve as the true description of astronomical black holes. For physical black holes, only their asymptotic structure before the horizon forms are detectible to the outside probes. Here, by investigating the scattering of a gravitational wave burst on a physical black hole and pay special attention to the echos in the waveform, we uncover distinct features of the echos both in the time and frequency domains.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture, portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score (0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions: Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles. Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a selection of candidates of clusters and protoclusters of galaxies identified in the photometric data of the HSC-SSP Wide Public Data Release 3 (PDR3), spanning the redshift range $\rm 0.1 \leq z \leq 2$. The selection method, detailed in Vicentin et al. (2025), involves detecting massive galaxies located in high-density regions of matter, identified as potential central dominant galaxies, i.e., (proto)BCGs. Probabilistic criteria based on proximity to the candidate central galaxy and the expected stellar mass of member galaxies are applied to identify likely members of each structure. We produced updated photometric redshift estimates using deep learning methods trained on a dataset combining spectroscopic redshifts from the HSC-SSP Wide PDR3, high-accuracy photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog, and mid-infrared data from the unWISE catalog for matched sources. Our method achieves a predicted purity of $\sim 90\%$ in detecting (proto)clusters, with $\gtrsim 65\%$ correctly identifying the (proto)BCG. A total of 16,007 candidate (proto)clusters were identified over an effective area of $\rm \sim 850 \ deg^{2}$ within the HSC-SSP Wide footprint. Comparisons with other existing catalogs reveal a good level of consistency, while also highlighting that different methods yield complementary discoveries. We further compare richness and halo masses from our optical catalog with those from recent X-ray cluster catalogs (eROSITA and MCXC-II), finding a moderate positive correlation and a scatter of $\rm \sim 0.4$ dex. This catalog provides a valuable new set of targets for the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) instrument.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.</div>

Recently, a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs), introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods, which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free, removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multiple structures within stellar groups are an intriguing subject for theoretical and observational studies of stellar formation. With the accuracy and completeness of data from Gaia Data Release 3, we now have new opportunities to detect reliable members of stellar groups across a larger field of view than in previous studies. In this work, using machine learning methods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting multiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to proper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values for these parameters. Next, we applied GMM to position, proper motion, and parallax for the members detected by DBSCAN. This approach allowed us to identify a filamentary structure among the DBSCAN-detected members. This structure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region. Subsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary structure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions, GMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our methods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500 arcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC 32. These four groups exhibit a single main-sequence distribution in the CMD, with proper motion values within three times the standard deviation and slightly differing parallax values, despite having distinct spatial structures. Furthermore, these four groups share the same radial velocity distribution. We provide documentation demonstrating the formation of these stellar groups as a multiple structure, with improved membership identification compared to previous studies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Latest advances in effective quantum gravity propose a quantum-corrected black hole solution that avoids Cauchy horizons. In this paper, we study the image of the black hole and explore the influence of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ on its image. First, we investigate the influence of $\zeta$ on the event horizon, photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and innermost stable circular orbit associated with the black hole. We find that all these quantities exhibit an increase with increasing $\zeta$. Meanwhile, we analyze the allowed range of $\zeta$ from both theoretical and observational perspectives. We then derive the photon trajectory equation and analyze briefly the behavior of the trajectories. A detailed analysis shows that as $\zeta$ increases, the photon trajectories near the event horizon undergo modifications. Finally, by plotting the optical appearance of the black hole under three emission models, we find that as $\zeta$ increases, the quantum-corrected black hole exhibits a larger shadow, along with a brightening of the bright rings and a reduction in the spacing between them near the critical impact parameter. Therefore, we can distinguish the quantum-corrected black hole from the Schwarzschild one by its unique optical appearance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\&#34;older-smooth missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to improve downstream learning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a new class of sequential change point tests, both for changes in the mean parameter and in the overall distribution function. The methodology builds on a two-window inspection scheme (TWIN), which aggregates data into symmetric samples and applies strong weighting to enhance statistical performance. The detector yields logarithmic rather than polynomial detection delays, representing a substantial reduction compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Delays remain short, even for late changes, where existing methods perform worst. Moreover, the new procedure also attains higher power than current methods across broad classes of local alternatives. For mean changes, we further introduce a self-normalized version of the detector that automatically cancels out temporal dependence, eliminating the need to estimate nuisance parameters. The advantages of our approach are supported by asymptotic theory, simulations and an application to monitoring COVID19 data. Here, structural breaks associated with new virus variants are detected almost immediately by our new procedures. This indicates potential value for the real-time monitoring of future epidemics. Mathematically, our approach is underpinned by new exponential moment bounds for the global modulus of continuity of the partial sum process, which may be of independent interest beyond change point testing.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an extension of our semi-analytic model that follows the formation of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological $N$-body simulations and feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to $z\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold $M_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict $\sim10$ active Pop III sources at $z = 10$ lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding $\mu &gt; 30$. These results demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical simulations, can provide accurate, computationally efficient predictions for the earliest stages of cosmic star formation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories. $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and data-efficient agents.</div>

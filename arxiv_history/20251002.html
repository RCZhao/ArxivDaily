                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Next-generation large-scale structure spectroscopic surveys will probe cosmology at high redshifts $(2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.5)$, relying on abundant galaxy tracers such as Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Medium-band photometry has emerged as a potential technique for efficiently selecting these high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we present clustering analysis of medium-band selected galaxies at high redshift, utilizing photometric data from the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) and spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We interpret the clustering of such samples using both Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling and a perturbation theory description of large-scale structure. Our modeling indicates that the current target sample is composed from an overlapping mixture of LAEs and LBGs with emission lines. Despite differences in target selection, we find that the clustering properties are consistent with previous studies, with correlation lengths $r_0\simeq 3-4\,h^{-1}$Mpc and a linear bias of $b\sim1.8-2.5$. Finally, we discuss the simulation requirements implied by these measurements and demonstrate that the properties of the samples would make them excellent targets to enhance our understanding of the high-$z$ universe.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z&lt;0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory&#39;s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} &gt;1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.</div>

The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Although numerous dynamical techniques have been developed to estimate the total dark matter halo mass of the Milky Way, it remains poorly constrained, with typical systematic uncertainties of 0.3 dex. In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\log_{10} M_\mathrm{vir}/\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cold dark matter (CDM) can be thought of as a 2D (or 3D) sheet of particles in 4D (or 6D) phase-space due to its negligible velocity dispersion. The large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments, they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped, and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to 3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Time-delay cosmography, by monitoring the multiply imaged gravitational lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique, which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale, extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale. We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1. In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers, inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone, necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance still exhibits a $6.2$\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty. This underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay errors accumulate along the LoS.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model&#39;s overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z_\dagger &lt; 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe&#39;s expansion history and the nature of dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmic voids are key elements in our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. They are crucial to constrain cosmological parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe, and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess the code&#39;s capabilities are carried out. AVISM&#39;s performance is also compared, both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is provided to demonstrate the code&#39;s ability to handle real data. We have designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids, leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void substructure.</div>

We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Universe consists of a variety of objects that formed at different epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and constrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two different values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP reconstructions, we find $\left=0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left=1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left=0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR) indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological estimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different evolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).</div>

The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2&#39;. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.</div>

We begin by defining generalized higher-order distortions and outlining methods for measuring them. Then, using several lens models, we examine how these distortions affect shear and flexion measurements. Our results show that neglecting higher-order distortions can introduce systematic errors of a few percent in both shear and flexion measurements, indicating that these effects cannot be ignored. Although the strength of these errors depends on factors such as lensing strength and the size of background sources, we demonstrate that simultaneous measurement of higher-order distortions can reduce the systematic errors to below 1% in most cases.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The research paper investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in a cloud of strings (CoS) and perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), incorporating a minor correction to the Anti de Sitter (AdS) length scale. The study reveals that while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal energy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications. Positive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities, leading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while negative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in divergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black hole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields, providing deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and thermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering minor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole behavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We revisit the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on the spatial curvature of the Universe, assessing how they change when the curvature parameter and the primordial inflationary scalar spectrum are treated consistently within theoretically motivated frameworks. Instead of relying on the phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects at the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic inflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a gauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the $\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find that the constraints on $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness. In $\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}&lt;0$ decreases from $\gtrsim 3.5\sigma$ to $\sim 2.5\sigma$, while in $\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces to $\sim 2\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 10$), our model explains the low-$\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the quadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high multipoles, worsening the fit to the $\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales. By contrast, in the $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly is less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis highlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature parameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing consistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations from flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of quadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for negative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly closed geometry.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding the origin of stars within a galaxy - whether formed in-situ or accreted from other galaxies (ex-situ) - is key to constraining its evolution. Spatially resolving these components provides crucial insights into a galaxy&#39;s mass assembly history. We aim to predict the spatial distribution of ex-situ stellar mass fraction in MaNGA galaxies, and to identify distinct assembly histories based on the radial gradients of these predictions in the central regions. We employ a diffusion model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA), derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The model learns to predict the posterior distribution of resolved ex-situ stellar mass fraction maps, conditioned on stellar mass density, velocity, and velocity dispersion gradient maps. After validating the model on an unseen test set from MaNGIA, we apply it to MaNGA galaxies to infer the spatially-resolved distribution of their ex-situ stellar mass fractions - i.e. the fraction of stellar mass in each spaxel originating from mergers. We identify four broad categories of ex-situ mass distributions: flat gradient, in-situ dominated; flat gradient, ex-situ dominated; positive gradient; and negative gradient. The vast majority of MaNGA galaxies fall in the first category - flat gradients with low ex-situ fractions - confirming that in-situ star formation is the main assembly driver for low- to intermediate-mass galaxies. At high stellar masses, the ex-situ maps are more diverse, highlighting the key role of mergers in building the most massive systems. Ex-situ mass distributions correlate with morphology, star-formation activity, stellar kinematics, and environment, indicating that accretion history is a primary factor shaping massive galaxies. Finally, by tracing their assembly histories in TNG50, we link each class to distinct merger scenarios, ranging from secular evolution to merger-dominated growth.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A physical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution benefits from an understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts. Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a galaxy&#39;s 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from satellite halos in $&gt; 90\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation and evolution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Hector Galaxy Survey is a new optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) survey currently using the AAT to observe up to 15,000 galaxies at low redshift ($z &lt; 0.1$). The Hector instrument employs 21 optical fibre bundles feeding into two double-beam spectrographs to enable wide-field multi-object IFS observations of galaxies. To efficiently process the survey data, we adopt the data reduction pipeline developed for the SAMI Galaxy Survey, with significant updates to accommodate Hector&#39;s dual-spectrograph system. These enhancements address key differences in spectral resolution and other instrumental characteristics relative to SAMI, and are specifically optimised for Hector&#39;s unique configuration. We introduce a two-dimensional arc fitting approach that reduces the RMS velocity scatter by a factor of 1.2--3.4 compared to fitting arc lines independently for each fibre. The pipeline also incorporates detailed modelling of chromatic optical distortion in the wide-field corrector, to account for wavelength-dependent spatial shifts across the focal plane. We assess data quality through a series of validation tests, including wavelength solution accuracy, spectral resolution, throughput characterisation, astrometric precision, sky subtraction residuals, and flux calibration stability (4\% systematic offset when compared to Legacy Survey fluxes). We demonstrate that Hector delivers high-fidelity, science-ready datasets, supporting robust measurements of galaxy kinematics, stellar populations, and emission-line properties, and provide examples. Additionally, we address systematic uncertainties identified during the data processing and propose future improvements to enhance the precision and reliability of upcoming data releases. This work establishes a robust data reduction framework for Hector, delivering high-quality data products that support a broad range of extragalactic studies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">How can we generate samples from a conditional distribution that we never fully observe? This question arises across a broad range of applications in both modern machine learning and classical statistics, including image post-processing in computer vision, approximate posterior sampling in simulation-based inference, and conditional distribution modeling in complex data settings. In such settings, compared with unconditional sampling, additional feature information can be leveraged to enable more adaptive and efficient sampling. Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple, adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity. We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on practical applications such as image denoising and image super-resolution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Digital tracking detects faint solar system bodies by stacking many images along hypothesized orbits, revealing objects that are undetectable in every individual exposure. Previous searches have been restricted to small areas and short time baselines. We present a general framework to quantify both sensitivity and computational requirements for digital tracking of nonlinear motion across the full sky over multi-year baselines. We start from matched-filter stacking and derive how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrades with trial orbit mismatch, which leads to a metric tensor on orbital parameter space. The metric defines local Euclidean coordinates in which SNR loss is isotropic, and a covariant density that specifies the exact number of trial orbits needed for a chosen SNR tolerance. We validate the approach with Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, recovering known objects in blind searches that stack thousands of images over six years along billions of trial orbits. We quantify ZTF&#39;s sensitivity to populations beyond 5 au and show that stacking reaches most of the remaining Planet 9 parameter space. The computational demands of all-sky, multi-year tracking are extreme, but we demonstrate that time segmentation and image blurring greatly reduce orbit density at modest sensitivity cost. Stacking effectively boosts medium-aperture surveys to the Rubin Observatory single-exposure depth across the northern sky. Digital tracking in dense Rubin observations of a 10 sq. deg field is tractable and could detect trans-Neptunian objects to 27th magnitude in a single night, with deep drilling fields reaching fainter still.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark matter (DM) particles traversing the Sun can lose energy through elastic scattering with solar nuclei and become gravitationally captured. For DM with masses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot nuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation. This defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which the Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional evaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically thick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this equilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a phase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming a Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that evaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention. With a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed, enabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical evaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either through repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive potential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and velocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail drives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar core. These modifications increase the equilibrium abundance of light DM by orders of magnitude and have direct implications for solar neutrino searches as an indirect probe of DM.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Efficient sampling from complex and high dimensional target distributions turns out to be a fundamental task in diverse disciplines such as scientific computing, statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we revisit the randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">For decades, the theoretical understanding of planetary nebulae (PNe) has remained in tension with the observed universal bright-end cutoff of the PN luminosity function (PNLF). While the brightest younger PN populations are expected to be brighter in their [OIII] emission than observed, recent studies have proposed circumnebular extinction to be a key ingredient for bringing their brightness down to the observed bright end. In this work we use the recently introduced PICS (PNe In Cosmological Simulations) framework to investigate the impact of different circumnebular extinction treatments on the modeled PNe and their PNLF for a large range of stellar ages and metallicities. We test how different slopes in the observed relation of extinction versus central star mass modify the bright-end cutoffs of the PNLF, finding that steeper slopes lead to large changes for young stellar populations. In contrast, the differences for older PNe are much smaller. However, for individual PNe, the extinctions observed in nearby galaxies appear to be much higher than the models predict, showing that improvements on both the modeling and observational sides are needed to gain a better understanding of the brightest and strongly extincted PNe. These findings further advance the theoretical foundation for interpreting observed extragalactic PN populations coming from more complex composite stellar populations in the future.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hard processes in collider experiments typically produce QCD jets, which have long served as precision tests of QCD in the vacuum. More recently, heavy-ion programs at RHIC and the LHC have offered a novel perspective on jets, establishing them as unique probes of strongly interacting matter. Experimental observations, including the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons and jets, provide compelling evidence for the formation of a new state of matter and its strong coupling to energetic partons. These advances have motivated new theoretical approaches to jet quenching that go beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of energy dissipation and thermalization of energetic partons in the quark-gluon plasma. This review highlights recent progress, beginning with a unified description of medium-induced radiation across the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime and its role in turbulent gluon cascades. We then examine radiative corrections that renormalize the transport coefficient $\hat q$, the mechanism of color decoherence in multi-parton systems, and nonlinear QCD evolution equations for jet energy loss. Finally, we confront this framework with experimental measurements, underscoring the need for precision phenomenology to fully exploit the rich data sets from RHIC and the LHC.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced &#34;critical point&#34;), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</div>

Although our construction is structurally simple, the resulting family is versatile: it includes both smooth and irregular examples, and reveals clear links between properties of the underlying univariate distribution and the strength, direction, and form of multivariate dependence. The framework brings with it a range of explicit mathematical properties, including interpretable characterizations of dependence and transparent descriptions of how rotational forms arise. We propose model selection and inference methods in parametric and nonparametric settings, supported by asymptotic theory that reduces multivariate estimation to well-studied univariate problems. Simulation studies confirm the reliable recovery of structural features, and an application involving neural connectivity data illustrates how the family can yield a better fit than existing models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\&#39;eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\&#39;eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework&#39;s generality.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality, is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.</div>

A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff &amp; Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.</div>

This dissipative effect arises as a backreaction from the neutrinos which are being driven slightly out of thermal equilibrium by the scalar. We estimate the rate of such thermal damping and explore its phenomenological implications. For a scalar that is produced early, we find that the effect of thermal damping results in a predictable final abundance largely insensitive to its initial condition while circumventing late time limits.

In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian, (ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions (CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN, including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices. Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses, and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations - and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass (nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population, excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we investigate the frame-dragging effect on an accretion disk and test gyroscope orbiting around a rotating regular black hole with a Minkowski core. Firstly, we perturb a bound timelike circular orbit around the black hole, and analyze the periastron precession and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession frequencies of the orbit&#39;s epicyclic oscillations. Since these epicyclic oscillations can be used to explain the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc around this rotating regular black hole, we then employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to fit our theoretical results with five QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564). The simulations give the relevant physical parameter space of the black hole, including the characteristic radius $r$, the mass related parameter $M$, the spinning parameter $a$ and the quantum gravity effect $\alpha$. The results give the constraint on the quantum effect parameter, with an upper limit $\alpha/M^{3/2} &lt; 0.60$ at the $95\%$ C.L., which is tighter than $&lt;0.7014$ in our pervious study within static case. Then, we theoretically explore the LT precession frequency, geodetic precession frequency, and the general spin precession frequency of a test gyro attached to a stationary observer in this black hole background. We find that the quantum gravity effect suppresses the precession frequencies comparing against those in Kerr black hole, further providing a theoretical diagnostic of the potential quantum gravity effect.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar shells and streams are remnants of satellite galaxies visible around galaxies. Advances in low-surface-brightness observations and increasing resolution of cosmological simulations now allow investigating the properties and origin of these features. The metallicity, age, and velocity dispersion of shells and streams are investigated to infer their progenitor galaxies properties. We employed the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Magneticum Pathfinder to extract these properties and identify the progenitors of the shells and streams. We compared to observational results from surveys and individual galaxies, matching and testing the methodology used in observations. Mock observations of shells and streams agree well with observational data regarding their morphology and spatial distribution. We find that both types of features are associated with localized depressions in stellar velocity dispersion compared to the surrounding regions. They are not as clearly distinct in metallicity and ages, though overall shells and more metal rich and streams are younger. We confirm results from idealized models that shells form commonly from radial major mergers but also through minor mergers, while streams usually form from minor mergers on circular orbits. We do not find the widths of streams to correlate with the half-mass radii of their progenitors, but the progenitors follow the mass-metallicity relation. On average, the masses measured for shells and streams approximately corresponds to 20% of the progenitor mass. We introduce a class of star-forming streams, which originate from in-situ star formation rather than the disruption of a satellite galaxy. Measuring stellar population properties of shells and streams provides the means to reconstruct the progenitor properties, and especially distinguish those streams that are not made through the disruption of a galaxy but formed in-situ.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy density, $N_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, which are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion rate, $H_0$, data, we find $N_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1~eV sterile neutrino, we find $N_{\rm eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N_{\rm eff}$, we find an upper limit of $m_s &lt; 0.17$ eV (95\% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker than standard constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light sterile neutrinos with masses $m_s\simeq0.1$--$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H_0$ data. The preferred $m_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to, that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1&lt;z&lt;8$, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_\rm{ion}$). We consider $\xi_\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ and $W_\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\beta_\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\xi_\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$, $W_\lambda$([OIII]) and $\beta_\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ or $W_\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\beta_\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.15\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_\rm{int}\sim0.035\,$dex.</div>

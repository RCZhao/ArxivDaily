                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new approach to measuring cosmic shear: the one-component Kinematic Lensing (KL) method. This technique provides a simplified implementation of KL that reduces shape noise in weak lensing (WL) by combining kinematic information with imaging data, while requiring less observational effort than the full two-component KL. We perform simulated likelihood analyses to assess the performance of the one-component KL and demonstrate its applicability to future radio surveys. Our forecasts indicate that, for radio surveys, the one-component KL is not yet competitive with traditional WL due to the shallow redshift distribution of HI-selected galaxies. However, when applying this method to deeper spectroscopic surveys with stronger emission lines, the one-component KL approach could surpass WL in constraining power, offering a promising and efficient pathway for future shear analyses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hydrodynamic simulations have proposed that stellar feedback and bursty star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to ``breathing modes&#39;&#39; (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential) which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and star-formation rate. In this paper, we test the dynamical effects of feedback-driven breathing modes using a sample of 103 star-forming low-mass galaxies with stellar masses between $7.9&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9.6$ and $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.19$. We measure ionized gas velocity dispersions from H$\alpha$ emission lines and compare them to mock observations from the FIRE-2 simulations. We compare gas velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{gas}$), stellar masses, and specific star-formation rates (sSFR). We find a positive correlation between gas velocity dispersion residuals at fixed stellar masses ($\rm \Delta\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR in both data and simulations. However, the relation is tighter in FIRE-2 compared to the data. FIRE-2 produces more low-sSFR galaxies compared to our observational sample, however, the sSFR distributions agree after limiting both samples to a minimum sSFR. A deeper and more complete photometric sample further indicates that observed low-mass galaxies could span the full range of sSFR predicted in the FIRE-2 simulations. Our results support the existence of short-timescale dynamical effects driven by gas outflow and inflow cycles in low-mass galaxies and motivate additional tests of the breathing mode.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The inner region of a subhalo&#39;s density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo&#39;s radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy&#39;s mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.</div>

The reconstruction of such a universal pressure profile requires an individual estimate of the mass of each cluster. In this context, we present a method to jointly fit, for the first time, the universal pressure profile and individual cluster $M_{500}$ masses over a sample of galaxy clusters, properly accounting for correlations between the profile shape and amplitude, and masses scaling the individual profiles. We demonstrate the power of the method and show that a consistent exploitation of the universal pressure profile and cluster mass estimates when modelling the thermal pressure in clusters is necessary to avoid biases. In particular, the method, informed by a cluster mass scale, outputs individual cluster masses with same accuracy and better precision than input masses. Using data from the {\guillemotleft}Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton: Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation{\guillemotright}, we investigate a sample of $\sim 25$ galaxy clusters spanning mass and redshift ranges of $2 \lesssim M_{500}/10^{14} \; \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \lesssim 14$ and $0.07 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Here we explore from a theoretical perspective the sensitivity of the primary CMB anisotropy trispectrum to parity violation (PV) in large-scale structure (LSS). We focus on the Sachs-Wolfe term, which dominates at $\ell &lt; 40$, after which the Doppler term takes over. We consider a model where the PV is only present out to some maximal scale $R$ of order a few hundred Mpc/$h$, consistent with what recent LSS 4PCF measurements seem to indicate. We find that the odd CMB trispectrum must be suppressed by at least one factor of $R/\chi_*$$\simeq$1\%, with $\chi_*$ the distance to last scattering, relative to the input matter 4PCF. Thus, a non-detection of PV in the CMB trispectrum is \textit{not necessarily inconsistent} with a genuine detection of PV in the LSS 4PCF.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic structure. The completeness of the Galactic open cluster census, however, remains poorly understood. For the first time ever, we establish the selection function of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an open-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced our cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection and retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue&#39;s sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that depends only on a cluster&#39;s number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data density, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple model accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\% accuracy on our training data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders of magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why certain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster detectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster&#39;s proper motion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster&#39;s orbital speed can result in an almost 3$\times$ higher detection probability, depending on its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and retrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other science cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using our results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open cluster census. Our work will enable a number of brand new types of study, such as detailed comparisons between the Milky Way&#39;s cluster census and recent extragalactic cluster samples.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous, gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55 at $z_\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts, $z_\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\pm2$ and $15\pm3$ companion galaxies exist with consistent $z_\text{phot}$ ($dz \leq 0.2$) within a projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\delta = 0.1 \pm 0.2$ and ${\delta} =1.0 \pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \pm 0.4)\sigma$ and $(2.2 \pm 0.6) \sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane, HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.</div>

Using the $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ algorithm to generate light-cone dark matter (DM) halo catalogues and the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ framework to forward-model the cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ signal, we construct tomographic mock surveys matched to the CCAT Observatory. We investigate both astrophysical models of $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from interstellar gas and the potential for the study of primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity (PING) as a science case for Stage 2 line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. The $\mathrm{[CII]}$ voxel intensity distribution (VID) is used as a summary statistic in forecasts. Additional constraints on PING are derived from a relative entropy study of $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo mass functions. We show that upcoming LIM surveys will provide insights into the way we model cosmological line emission, and next-generation surveys can place competitive bounds on novel inflationary scenarios such as PING.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped within their source model&#39;s architecture, herein referred to architectural lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the geometric structures formed by the model&#39;s internal neuron activations, of two distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen &#34;behavioral kernel.&#34; It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection heads that translate the target model&#39;s activation stream into the source model&#39;s latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back. This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data, effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We demonstrate that CAST enables true &#34;zero-shot&#34; translation of any standard LoRA adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve 85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model, quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.</div>

Specifically, we analyze simulated power spectra generated by a local oscillatory primordial feature template motivated by non-standard inflation.

Each primordial power spectrum is reconstructed by linearly interpolating $N$ knots in the $\{\log k, \log P_{\mathcal{R}}(k)\}$ plane, which are sampled jointly with the cosmological parameters $\{H_0,\Omega_b h^2, \Omega_c h^2\}$ using PolyChord. To test the primordial features, we apply two statistical tools: the Bayes factor and a hypothesis test that localizes the scales where features are detected. We assess the recovery under different J-PAS specifications, including redshift binning, tracer type, survey area, and filter strategy. Our results show that combining redshift bins and tracers allows the detection of oscillatory features as small as 2\%.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources. Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders. Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD) and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across different scenarios.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The detection of primordial $B$-mode polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major observational goal in modern Cosmology, offering a potential window into inflationary physics through the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses significant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we explore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test to validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features associated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as observed by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and foregrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind component separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used to generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared with those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by component separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results demonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can not be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as we find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant warnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground residuals. In the most realistic and refined scenario we adopted, the test is able to flag non-Gaussianity in $\sim 26\%$ of the simulations, meaning that there is no warning on the biased tensor-to-scalar ratio in $\sim 74\%$ of cases. These results suggest that more advanced statistics than MFs must be considered to look for non-Gaussian signatures of foregrounds, in order to be able to perform reliable null tests in future CMB missions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present relativistic $N$-body simulations of a $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM - sign-switching cosmological constant (CC) - scenario under general relativity and compare its nonlinear matter power spectrum to $\Lambda$CDM at ${z = 15,\,2,\,1,\,0}$, using best-fit parameters from Planck-only and a combined &#39;&#39;full&#39;&#39; dataset. During the AdS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses, but does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio $P_{\Lambda_{\rm s}\rm CDM}/P_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced, redshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\sim 20-25\%}$ around ${k \simeq 1-3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates to larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\sim 15-20\%}$ uplift at ${k \simeq 0.6-1.0\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These wavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the sensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and tSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by a scale-independent change in $\sigma_8$ or $S_8$. The timing (earlier for Planck-only, later for the full dataset) and the amplitude of the crest align with the &#39;&#39;cosmic noon&#39;&#39; epoch (${z \simeq 1-2}$), offering a gravitational prior for the observed peak in the cosmic star-formation rate.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</div>

Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle, linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction. The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B, sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley&#39;&#39; structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We explored a parameterized slow-roll inflationary model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework, utilizing a combination of data from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and BICEP/Keck 2018 (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Additionally, we incorporated the SH0ES prior on $H_0$ (P-ACT-LB-BK18-$H_0$) to analyze the model within the early dark energy (EDE) framework. While the model with a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^\alpha$ for small values of $\alpha$ still fits the data, the Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation falls outside the $2\sigma$ region. On the other hand, in a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, higher-order corrections to $R$ are typically anticipated. In response, we proposed a non-perturbative exponential $f(R)$ inflation model, wherein the subleading corrections beyond $R^2$ including terms like $R^3$ or $R^4$. Using numerical calculations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the P-ACT-LB-BK18 data set, we demonstrate that this model can align well with the ACT-preferred value of the scalar spectral index. Additionally, within the early dark energy (EDE) framework, it accommodates greater deviations from the original Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation model when incorporating the SH0ES prior on $H_0$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a multifrequency and multi-instrument methodology to study the physical properties of galaxy clusters and cosmic filaments using cosmic microwave background observations. Our approach enables simultaneous measurement of both the thermal (tSZ) and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effects, incorporates relativistic corrections, and models astrophysical foregrounds such as thermal dust emission. We do this by jointly fitting a single physical model across multiple maps from multiple instruments at different frequencies, rather than fitting a model to a single Compton-$y$ map. We demonstrate the success of this method by fitting the Abell 399-Abell 401 galaxy cluster pair and filament system using archival data from the Planck satellite and new, targeted deep data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, covering 11 different frequencies over 14 maps from 30 GHz to 545 GHz. Our tSZ results are consistent with previous work using Compton-$y$ maps. We measure the line-of-sight peculiar velocities of the cluster-filament system using the kSZ effect and find statistical uncertainties on individual cluster peculiar velocities of $\lesssim $600 km s$^{-1}$, which are competitive with current state-of-the-art measurements. Additionally, we measure the optical depth of the filament component with a signal-to-noise of 8.5$\sigma$ and reveal hints of its morphology. This modular approach is well-suited for application to future instruments across a wide range of millimeter and sub-millimeter wavebands.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study non-linear Bayesian inverse problems arising from semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that can be transformed into linear Bayesian inverse problems. We are then able to extend the early stopping for Ensemble Kalman-Bucy Filter (EnKBF) to these types of linearisable nonlinear problems as a way to tune the prior distribution. Using the linearisation method introduced in \cite{koers2024}, we transform the non-linear problem into a linear one, apply early stopping based on the discrepancy principle, and then pull back the resulting posterior to the posterior for the original parameter of interest. Following \cite{tienstra2025}, we show that this approach yields adaptive posterior contraction rates and frequentist coverage guarantees, under mild conditions on the prior covariance operator. From this, it immediately follows that Tikhonov regularisation coupled with the discrepancy principle contracts at the same rate. The proposed method thus provides a data-driven way to tune Gaussian priors via early stopping, which is both computationally efficient and statistically near optimal for nonlinear problems. Lastly, we demonstrate our results theoretically and numerically for the classical benchmark problem, the time-independent Schr\&#34;odinger equation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE&#39;s nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590 centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities from the [S~II]~$\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of $\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$. Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm 3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} = 40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model&#39;s specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding generalization in overparameterized neural networks hinges on the interplay between the data geometry, neural architecture, and training dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability. First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls, we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension. Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder to &#34;shatter&#34; with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons, gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical findings that have appeared in the literature.</div>

To capture this structure in a model-agnostic way, we introduce a minimal parameterization that encodes the dominant geometric information with three parameters. Using a custom-built Monte-Carlo tool for near-continuous spectra, we simulate DM-pair production at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and subsequent cascade decays via on/off-shell $Z$ bosons, which yield events with large missing transverse momentum and high jet multiplicity. Recasting the CMS multijet$+H_T^{\rm miss}$ analysis of Run-2 data (35.9 fb$^{-1}$), we derive bounds on the model parameter space. Extrapolating these bounds, we provide High-Luminosity LHC projections (3 ab$^{-1}$). We also project sensitivities for future electron-positron colliders at $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV and $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, showing substantial improvements over the HL-LHC. The current LHC sensitivity is beginning to approach the theoretically motivated region of the parameter space, while future colliders will be able to comprehensively test this model.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to approximate a maximum likelihood estimator. This creates a barrier for statisticians, as the principles behind VAEs and DDMs are hard to contextualize without a corresponding Frequentist introduction to VI. This paper provides that introduction: we explain the theory for VI, VAEs, and DDMs from a purely Frequentist perspective, starting with the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show how VI arises as a scalable solution for intractable E-steps and how VAEs and DDMs are natural, deep-learning-based extensions of this framework, thereby bridging the gap between classical statistical inference and modern generative AI.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety, instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation, approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set, distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model&#39;s original dataset.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Thermal dust is the major polarized foreground hindering the detection of primordial CMB B-modes. Its signal presents a complex behavior in frequency space inherited from the joint variation in our Galaxy of the orientation of magnetic fields and of the spectral properties of dust grains aligned with magnetic field lines. In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing the thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual maps, represented as complex quantities, that capture deviations of the local polarized SED from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We make simple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and covariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the emitting aligned grains. The validation or falsification of these predictions provide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal. We confront our predictions with Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic plane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the statistical properties of the data. The spectral dependence of the covariances between residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a dust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index variations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck official release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision polarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB community.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the Dekel--Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8--0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model, and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model, which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric, orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning, while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance improvements while maintaining training efficiency.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus from external heuristics to the model&#39;s internal mechanisms. We find that complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate CircuitSeer&#39;s superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</div>

The analysis of a sample of phylogenetic trees can be conducted in Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann tree space, which is a CAT(0) metric space of phylogenetic trees. The globally non-positively curved (CAT(0)) property of this space enables the extension of various statistical techniques. In the problem of nonparametric density estimation, two primary methods, kernel density estimation and log-concave maximum likelihood estimation, have been proposed, yet their theoretical properties remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proving the consistency of these estimators in a more general setting$\unicode{x2014}$CAT(0) orthant spaces, which include BHV tree space. We extend log-concave approximation techniques to this setting and establish consistency via the continuity of the log-concave projection map. We also modify the kernel density estimator to correct boundary bias and establish uniform consistency using empirical process theory.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Classical deep neural networks can learn rich multi-particle correlations in collider data, but their inductive biases are rarely anchored in physics structure. We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller, independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gauged&#39;&#39; $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the string-wall network.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The gas mass fraction of galaxy groups and clusters is a key physical quantity for constraining the impact of feedback processes on large-scale structure. While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible. For haloes with M500 &lt; 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun &lt; M500 &lt; 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that can be tested with future observational measurements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes play a prominent role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) due to their sensitivity to new physics at the TeV scale. Meson-antimeson transitions and rare meson decays provide stringent constraints on new physics through precision measurements of observables such as mass differences, CP asymmetries, and branching ratios. Extensions of the SM based on the $\text{SU}(3)_C \times \text{SU}(3)_L \times \text{U}(1)_N$ gauge group offer a compelling framework for flavor physics, as FCNC processes emerge inexorably at tree level due to the non-universal transformations of the quark families. Among its various realizations, the version incorporating right-handed neutrinos (331RHN) is the most phenomenologically viable. This review synthesizes three decades of theoretical developments in FCNC phenomenology within the 331RHN model, from early $Z^\prime$-dominated studies to the recent recognition of the decisive role played by the SM-like Higgs boson and the identification of the alignment limit. We demonstrate that viable parameter space spans orders of magnitude, from $m_{Z^\prime} \sim$ a few hundred GeV to $\sim 100$ TeV, depending critically on quark mixing parametrizations and scalar alignment configurations, with significant implications for experimental searches at current and future colliders.</div>

We compare systematically observational bounds with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\alpha$-Starobinsky) and T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with $\alpha \lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\alpha = 1$) predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 - 10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95% confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility. T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\alpha \lesssim 11$ in these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $\alpha$-attractors with monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum, demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 - 0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6 data.

After computing the eigenvalues analytically and/or numerically from this matrix, we impose perturbative unitarity bounds on them. We tested our method on various models and validated the results against the literature. Finally, as a concrete application of our approach, we discuss the case of the minimal left-right symmetric model and derive, for the first time, the perturbative unitarity constraints in the Pati-Salam model.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Sampling from log-concave distributions is a central problem in statistics and machine learning. Prior work establishes theoretical guarantees for Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm based on overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics and, more recently, some third-order variants. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling algorithm built on a general $K$th-order Langevin dynamics, extending beyond second- and third-order methods. To discretize the $K$th-order dynamics, we approximate the drift induced by the potential via Lagrange interpolation and refine the node values at the interpolation points using Picard-iteration corrections, yielding a flexible scheme that fully utilizes the acceleration of higher-order Langevin dynamics. For targets with smooth, strongly log-concave densities, we prove dimension-dependent convergence in Wasserstein distance: the sampler achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy within $\widetilde O(d^{\frac{K-1}{2K-3}}\varepsilon^{-\frac{2}{2K-3}})$ gradient evaluations for $K \ge 3$. To our best knowledge, this is the first sampling algorithm achieving such query complexity. The rate improves with the order $K$ increases, yielding better rates than existing first to third-order approaches.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods, however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence, which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The repeating changing-look active galactic nuclei (RCL AGNs) exhibit multiple appearances and disappearances of broad emission lines (BELs), whose underlying mechanism remains a puzzle. Expanding the sample of RCL AGNs is valuable for constraining the transition timescale and probing the accretion physics driving CL behaviors. This study aims to identify RCL AGNs using the multi-epoch spectroscopic data of confirmed CL AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, supplemented with mid-infrared (MIR) light curves. Through selection criteria and visual inspection, we identify 25 RCL AGNs among 331 CL AGNs, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about $8\%$, indicating that repeated transitions are not rare in CL AGNs. Among the 25 RCL AGNs, 19 are newly identified, which significantly expands the known RCL AGN sample. Based on the spectra and densely sampled MIR light curves, we derive reliable turn-on transition timescales for 19 RCL AGNs, and find no significant correlation between the timescale and the black hole mass.</div>

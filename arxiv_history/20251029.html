                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z&gt;1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Determining the distribution of redshifts for galaxies in wide-field photometric surveys is essential for robust cosmological studies of weak gravitational lensing. We present the methodology, calibrated redshift distributions, and uncertainties of the final Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (Y6) weak lensing galaxy data, divided into four redshift bins centered at $\langle z \rangle = [0.414, 0.538, 0.846, 1.157]$. We combine independent information from two methods on the full shape of redshift distributions: optical and near-infrared photometry within an improved Self-Organizing Map $p(z)$ (SOMPZ) framework, and cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements (WZ), which we demonstrate to be consistent both in terms of the redshift calibration itself and in terms of resulting cosmological constraints within 0.1$\sigma$. We describe the process used to produce an ensemble of redshift distributions that account for several known sources of uncertainty. Among these, imperfection in the calibration sample due to the lack of faint, representative spectra is the dominant factor. The final uncertainty on mean redshift in each bin is $\sigma_{\langle z\rangle} = [0.012, 0.008,0.009, 0.024]$. We ensure the robustness of the redshift distributions by leveraging new image simulations and a cross-check with galaxy shape information via the shear ratio (SR) method.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary coalescence provide direct measurement of the luminosity distance to the event. However, unlike binary neutron stars, redshift information is not available from GW observations of binary black holes. Consequently, independent redshift measurements of such GW events are necessary to measure $H_0$. In this study, we demonstrate a novel Bayesian formalism to infer $H_0$ utilizing the $3$D cross-correlation of GW events with galaxies from flux-limited catalog in configuration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with $300$ simulated GW events distributed within $1$ Gpc in colored Gaussian noise of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O4 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\sim 9 \%$ ($90\%$ highest density interval). We highlight the potential improvements that need to be accounted for in further studies before the method can be applied to real data.</div>

Beyond H-ATLAS, Herschel produced additional sub-mm catalogues, though not optimised for spatial statistical lensing analyses.} {Our goal is to refine cosmological constraints from SMG magnification bias by exploiting the full sub-mm sky surveyed by Herschel.} {We expanded the SMG sample by incorporating other Herschel catalogues overlapping SDSS spectroscopic lenses. Random catalogues were generated via kernel density estimation to compute cross-correlations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to infer astrophysical and cosmological parameters for each catalogue and for the combined dataset.} {We report the first detection of magnification bias in SMGs beyond H-ATLAS, reinforcing the robustness of this observable. Individual Herschel catalogues yield reasonable central values for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, although with large uncertainties.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we explore a new type of smooth and well-behaved polynomial redshift function that can avoid a future singularity. Using this function, we have proposed different redshift parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state, drawing motivation from different polynomial functions like conventional polynomial, Legendre polynomial, Laguerre polynomial, Chebyshev polynomial and Fibonacci polynomial. The main feature of these parametrizations is their well-behaved nature throughout the evolution of the universe, which was a matter of concern in most of the previous polynomial parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS). This form of parametrization may be considered as an extension of those forms with no divergence at any redshift value. A comprehensive observational data analysis is performed with the Hubble, BAO and DESI datasets to constrain the parameter space of the models. Confidence contours showing joint and marginalized posterior distribution with different combinations of datasets are generated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We see that our improved parametrizations enable us to derive more stringent restrictions on the current dark energy EoS and its derivative, which improves performance. Finally, a machine learning analysis is performed using some suitable algorithms like ELR, PILR, ANN, SVR, ERFR and GBR to compare the models. Among all the tested polynomial bases, the Legendre basis demonstrated superior performance with the lowest test RMSE and reduced $\chi^{2}$ value under the Modified Differential Evolution theoretical model, indicating exceptional physical accuracy and numerical stability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP&#39;s Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars&#39; wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack&#39;s sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</div>

First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this study, we build upon the findings of Del Popolo et al. (2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al. (2013). This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al. (2004).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Despite the large uncertainties in the equation of state for neutron stars (NSs), a tight universal ``Love-Q&#39;&#39; relation exists between their dimensionless tidal deformability, $\Lambda$, and the dimensionless quadrupole moment, $Q$. However, this relation has not yet been directly measured through observations. Gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary NS (BNS) coalescences provide an avenue for such a measurement. In this study, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian framework and combine multiple simulated GW events to measure the Love-Q relation. We simulate 1000 GW sources and select 20 events with the highest signal-to-noise ratios and NS spins for the analysis. By inspecting four parameterization models of the Love-Q relation, we observe strong correlations between the model parameters. We verify that a linear relation between $\ln\Lambda$ and $\ln Q$ is practically sufficient to describe the Love-Q relation with the precision expected from next-generation GW detectors. Furthermore, we utilize the inferred Love-Q relation to test modified gravity. Taking the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an example, our results suggest that the characteristic length can be constrained to $10\, \mathrm{km}$ or less with future GW observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures play a crucial role in understanding galaxy evolution by providing significant insights into galaxy interactions, the histories of mass assembly, and the distribution of dark matter. Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features. The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</div>

This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem&#34;, which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way&#39;s last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process. As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer, and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical results.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this article, we introduce the concept of \textit{topographic enhancement} in the context of ultra-high-energy neutrino detection by underwater neutrino telescopes. We demonstrate that the local topography around KM3NeT/ARCA can increase the detection efficiency in scenarios involving long-lived particles by up to a factor of $\sim 3$ due to the presence of an underwater mountain range in the direction of Malta. We consider a simplified model-independent approach that parametrizes the new physics able to generate both track-like and cascade-like signals in neutrino telescopes. When explaining the KM3-230213A event with a diffuse dark flux hypothesis, including its azimuthal direction--in addition to the zenith angle--provides additional constraints on the parameter space. In this effective model, the observations by KM3NeT and ANITA-IV can be simultaneously explained and the global tension with the lack of a corresponding detection in IceCube is reduced to 2.4 sigma. This work underscores the importance of incorporating topographic effects in the design and optimization of next-generation neutrino telescopes, as is done in the context of mountain-based detectors such as TAMBO. We present a numerical code which can be used to easily extend this topographical analysis to other experiments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper studies prediction with multiple candidate models, where the goal is to combine their outputs. This task is especially challenging in heterogeneous settings, where different models may be better suited to different inputs. We propose input adaptive Bayesian Model Averaging (IA-BMA), a Bayesian method that assigns model weights conditional on the input. IA-BMA employs an input adaptive prior, and yields a posterior distribution that adapts to each prediction, which we estimate with amortized variational inference. We derive formal guarantees for its performance, relative to any single predictor selected per input. We evaluate IABMA across regression and classification tasks, studying data from personalized cancer treatment, credit-card fraud detection, and UCI datasets. IA-BMA consistently delivers more accurate and better-calibrated predictions than both non-adaptive baselines and existing adaptive methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present MMbeddings, a probabilistic embedding approach that reinterprets categorical embeddings through the lens of nonlinear mixed models, effectively bridging classical statistical theory with modern deep learning. By treating embeddings as latent random effects within a variational autoencoder framework, our method substantially decreases the number of parameters -- from the conventional embedding approach of cardinality $\times$ embedding dimension, which quickly becomes infeasible with large cardinalities, to a significantly smaller, cardinality-independent number determined primarily by the encoder architecture. This reduction dramatically mitigates overfitting and computational burden in high-cardinality settings. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets, encompassing collaborative filtering and tabular regression tasks using varied architectures, demonstrate that MMbeddings consistently outperforms traditional embeddings, underscoring its potential across diverse machine learning applications.</div>

This review aims to summarize the core principles and unique advantages of cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies and discuss recent results applied for cosmological inference.

This approach allows us to constrain cosmographic parameters and test CDDR at a particular redshift. Further, it does not rely on data reconstructions or extrapolations of the cosmographic parameters to higher redshifts. We employ observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Baryon Acoustic Oscillation dataset, cosmic chronometers, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus and Dark Energy Survey Year 5 compilations. We find no significant deviations from the standard CDDR relation, with constraints reaching sub-percent precision across most redshifts in the range $0\lesssim z \lesssim 1$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques, creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications, offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent&#39;s adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code \texttt{BARYONET}. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it. We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting \texttt{BARYONET} implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications. In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$\emph{diffusion constants}, \emph{Yukawa/helicity-flip rates}, and \emph{strong/weak sphaleron rates}$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission are significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations, posing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO), we present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the color--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two competing models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a pure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the statistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and random fields show that a threshold of BF &gt; 100 effectively distinguishes genuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a robust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The framework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating kinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems, including candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.</div>

In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated measurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral (HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the distance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the northern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by identifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to be nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct simulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We use the galaxy&#39;s surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock observations with the {\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). These mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations, employing JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their associated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar kinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$ out to distances of $\sim$20 Mpc.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities. Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the \textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user&#39;s images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we consider a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for training deep neural networks and provide a new global convergence guarantee under strictly monotonically increasing activation functions. While existing works demonstrate convergence to stationary points for BCD in neural networks, our contribution is the first to prove convergence to global minima, ensuring arbitrarily small loss. We show that the loss with respect to the output layer decreases exponentially while the loss with respect to the hidden layers remains well-controlled. Additionally, we derive generalization bounds using the Rademacher complexity framework, demonstrating that BCD not only achieves strong optimization guarantees but also provides favorable generalization performance. Moreover, we propose a modified BCD algorithm with skip connections and non-negative projection, extending our convergence guarantees to ReLU activation, which are not strictly monotonic. Empirical experiments confirm our theoretical findings, showing that the BCD algorithm achieves a small loss for strictly monotonic and ReLU activations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using a large observational sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the spatial alignment between galaxy pairs and their local cosmic filaments. Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\sim$7\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web&#39;s critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to train a machine learning model using both labelled and unlabelled data. While the unlabelled data have been used in various ways to improve the prediction accuracy, the reason why unlabelled data could help is not fully understood. One interesting and promising direction is to understand SSL from a causal perspective. In light of the independent causal mechanisms principle, the unlabelled data can be helpful when the label causes the features but not vice versa. However, the causal relations between the features and labels can be complex in real world applications. In this paper, we propose a SSL framework that works with general causal models in which the variables have flexible causal relations. More specifically, we explore the causal graph structures and design corresponding causal generative models which can be learned with the help of unlabelled data. The learned causal generative model can generate synthetic labelled data for training a more accurate predictive model. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method by empirical studies on both simulated and real data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection. However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by 53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey simulation.</div>

For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps. Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4 family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards. Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs. Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.</div>

The Einstein field equations are solved for a nonlinear ModMax electromagnetic source in the context of $F(R)$ gravity and a string cloud.

Our findings reveal that the interplay between nonlinear electrodynamics, $F(R)$ gravity, and the string cloud significantly alters spacetime geometry, leading to distinct dynamical behaviors for test particles while also amplifying the shadow radius.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150~MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Bo\&#34;{o}tes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN&#39;s understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance. Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Physics-informed statistical learning (PISL) integrates empirical data with physical knowledge to enhance the statistical performance of estimators. While PISL methods are widely used in practice, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how informed regularization affects statistical properties is still missing. Specifically, two fundamental questions have yet to be fully addressed: (1) what is the trade-off between considering soft penalties versus hard constraints, and (2) what is the statistical gain of incorporating physical knowledge compared to purely data-driven empirical error minimisation. In this paper, we address these questions for PISL in convex classes of functions under physical knowledge expressed as linear equations by developing appropriate complexity dependent error rates based on the small-ball method. We show that, under suitable assumptions, (1) the error rates of physics-informed estimators are comparable to those of hard constrained empirical error minimisers, differing only by constant terms, and that (2) informed penalization can effectively reduce model complexity, akin to dimensionality reduction, thereby improving learning performance. This work establishes a theoretical framework for evaluating the statistical properties of physics-informed estimators in convex classes of functions, contributing to closing the gap between statistical theory and practical PISL, with potential applications to cases not yet explored in the literature.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response, including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical, computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.</div>

Specifically, we explore the performance of AI Poincar\&#39;e in analyzing numerical trajectory data obtained using the McMillan system of non-linear integrable optics. A comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm&#39;s performance is conducted through diverse methodologies. These include the analysis of the estimated number of conserved quantities embedded in a dataset and the deviation of interpolated points on the inferred manifold with respect to points in actually in the dataset. the investigation identifies an optimal range of perturbation distances where the underlying manifold extraction algorithm inside AI Poincar\&#39;e exhibits optimal performance. Additionally, an improved neural network architecture is proposed based on the observed results.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, we investigate a cosmological scenario with a time-dependent cosmological constant $\Lambda$(t) within the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework. Here we study a power-law $\Lambda(t)$CDM model characterized by a dynamic cosmological constant expressed as a function of the Hubble parameter and its derivative $\Lambda(t)$ $=\alpha (\dot H+H^{2})+\lambda H^2+4\pi G\rho\eta.$ Using recent observational datasets (DESI BAO, OHD, and PP\&amp;SH0ES), we constrain the model&#39;s free parameters $(H_{0},\alpha,\lambda,\eta)$ and analyze their impact on key cosmological quantities. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of the best-fit value of $H_{0}=71.9\pm 0.23$ km/s/Mpc from PP\&amp;SH0ES analysis only, which substantially alleviates the existing tension between early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant, reducing it to $\sim1.5\sigma$. The reconstructed $Om$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating a dynamic dark energy behavior with quintessence-like characteristics ($\omega&gt;-1$). These results suggest that the proposed $\Lambda(t)$ model provides a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe. Our findings show that this model alleviates the Hubble tension more effectively than the standard $\Lambda$CDM . The model also demonstrates compatibility with late-time Hubble parameter observations and offers a compelling framework to address the limitations of $\Lambda$CDM.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Schr\&#34;odinger bridge problem seeks the optimal stochastic process that connects two given probability distributions with minimal energy modification. While the Sinkhorn algorithm is widely used to solve the static optimal transport problem, a recent work (Pooladian and Niles-Weed, 2024) proposed the Sinkhorn bridge, which estimates Schr\&#34;odinger bridges by plugging optimal transport into the time-dependent drifts of SDEs, with statistical guarantees in the one-sample estimation setting where the true source distribution is fully accessible. In this work, to further justify this method, we study the statistical performance of intermediate Sinkhorn iterations in the two-sample estimation setting, where only finite samples from both source and target distributions are available. Specifically, we establish a statistical bound on the squared total variation error of Sinkhorn bridge iterations: $O(1/m+1/n + r^{4k})~(r \in (0,1))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sample sizes from the source and target distributions, respectively, and $k$ is the number of Sinkhorn iterations. This result provides a theoretical guarantee for the finite-sample performance of the Schr\&#34;odinger bridge estimator and offers practical guidance for selecting sample sizes and the number of Sinkhorn iterations. Notably, our theoretical results apply to several representative methods such as [SF]$^2$M, DSBM-IMF, BM2, and LightSB(-M) under specific settings, through the previously unnoticed connection between these estimators.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions -- traced by galaxy distributions -- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials -- traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($&gt; 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Uncovering the underlying causal mechanisms of complex real-world systems remains a significant challenge, as these systems often entail high data collection costs and involve unknown interventions. We introduce MetaCaDI, the first framework to cast the joint discovery of a causal graph and unknown interventions as a meta-learning problem. MetaCaDI is a Bayesian framework that learns a shared causal graph structure across multiple experiments and is optimized to rapidly adapt to new, few-shot intervention target prediction tasks. A key innovation is our model&#39;s analytical adaptation, which uses a closed-form solution to bypass expensive and potentially unstable gradient-based bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and complex gene expression data demonstrate that MetaCaDI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It excels at both causal graph recovery and identifying intervention targets from as few as 10 data instances, proving its robustness in data-scarce scenarios.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study how out-of-equilibrium effects modify the steady-state propagation of bubble walls during a cosmological first-order electroweak phase transition. Going beyond the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we numerically solve the coupled system of scalar field, hydrodynamic and Boltzmann equations using a spectral algorithm that allows a first-principle treatment of the collision integral. This approach enables a quantitative assessment of non-equilibrium perturbations in the plasma and their backreaction on the wall motion. Focusing on the singlet extension of the Standard Model as a minimal benchmark scenario, we find that out-of-equilibrium corrections substantially enhance the effective friction on the expanding front, leading to slower wall velocities and broader wall profiles compared to the equilibrium case. These modifications have significant implications for cosmological observables. For instance, they enhance the efficiency of electroweak baryogenesis, thus improving the viability of baryon asymmetry generation within realistic parameter regions that can also be probed by future gravitational wave interferometers.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables. While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase, respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced, eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for science, policy, and decision-making.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k &lt;= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Online learning algorithms continually update their models as data arrive, making it essential to accurately estimate the expected loss at the current time step. The prequential method is an effective estimation approach which can be practically deployed in various ways. However, theoretical guarantees have previously been established under strong conditions on the algorithm, and practical algorithms have hyperparameters which require careful tuning. We introduce OEUVRE, an estimator that evaluates each incoming sample on the function learned at the current and previous time steps, recursively updating the loss estimate in constant time and memory. We use algorithmic stability, a property satisfied by many popular online learners, for optimal updates and prove consistency, convergence rates, and concentration bounds for our estimator. We design a method to adaptively tune OEUVRE&#39;s hyperparameters and test it across diverse online and stochastic tasks. We observe that OEUVRE matches or outperforms other estimators even when their hyperparameters are tuned with oracle access to ground truth.</div>

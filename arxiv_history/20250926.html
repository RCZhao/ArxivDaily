                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Peculiar velocity measurements constrain the parameter combination $f\sigma_8$, the product of the linear growth rate $f$ and the fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$. Under the approximation that $f$ is a monotonic function of $\Omega_{\rm m}$, this can be related to $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$, enabling direct comparison with weak lensing and cosmic microwave background results. We exploit this by using three classes of direct-distance tracers -- the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane, and Type~Ia supernovae -- to infer peculiar velocities. A unified hierarchical forward model jointly calibrates each distance indicator and a linear theory reconstruction of the local Universe. This is the first consistent Bayesian analysis to combine all three major classes of distance indicators within a common framework, enabling cross-checks of systematics across diverse galaxy populations. All three tracers yield consistent values of $S_8$ that are also in agreement with Planck. Our joint constraint is $S_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.030$, with the uncertainty dominated by the 2M++ galaxy field. These results demonstrate that peculiar velocity surveys provide a robust, consistent measurement of $S_8$, and support concordance with the cosmic microwave background.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this study, we investigate the distribution and origin of chemical elements in different stellar components of simulated Milky Way-like galaxies in relation to their mass assembly history, stellar age, and metallicity. Using a sample of 23 simulated galaxies from the Auriga project, we analysed the evolution of heavy elements produced by stellar nucleosynthesis. To study the chemical evolution of the stellar halo, bulge, and warm and cold discs of the model galaxies, we applied a decomposition method to characterise the distribution of chemical elements at $z=0$ and traced back their origin. Our findings indicate that each stellar component has a distinctive chemical trend despite galaxy-to-galaxy variations. Specifically, stellar haloes are $\alpha$-enhanced relative to other components, representing the oldest populations, with [Fe/H] ~ $-$0.6 and a high fraction of ex situ stars of ~ 50%. They are followed by the warm ([Fe/H] ~ $-$0.1) and cold ([Fe/H] ~ 0) discs, with in situ fractions of ~ 90% and ~ 95%, respectively. Alternatively, bulges are mainly formed in situ but host more diverse stellar populations, with [Fe/H] abundance extending over ~ 1 dex around the solar value. We conclude that one of the main drivers shaping the chemical properties of the galactic components in our simulations is the age-metallicity relation. The bulges are the least homogeneous component of the sample, as they present different levels of contribution from young stars in addition to the old stellar component. Conversely, the cold discs appear very similar in all chemical properties, despite important differences in their typical formation times. Finally, we find that a significant fraction of stars in the warm discs were in the cold disc at birth. We discuss the possible connections of this behaviour with the development of bars and interactions with satellites.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$), thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models with forthcoming observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of ``baryon nulling&#39;&#39; using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. {This could reduce some systematics in the observed data, if present}. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the dense cores of dwarf galaxies (DGs), considering both hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs). Extending our previous merger framework, we incorporate up to four successive generations of PBHs within a Hubble time and quantify the GW emission from both channels. Our results show that while BBHs dominate the total emission, CHEs occur earlier, provide the first GW signals, and contribute a continuous though subdominant background that becomes relatively more significant once the initial PBH population is depleted and binary formation is suppressed. We compute the resulting SGWB spectra, demonstrating that BBHs and CHEs imprint distinct frequency dependencies consistent with analytical expectations. We then compare the predicted signals with the sensitivity of observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, ET, IPTA, and SKA.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Over the past decades, significant efforts have been devoted to developing sophisticated algorithms for automatically identifying and classifying radio sources in large surveys. However, even the most advanced methods face challenges in recognising complex radio structures and accurately associating radio emission with their host galaxies. Leveraging data from the ASKAP telescope and the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, Radio Galaxy Zoo EMU (RGZ EMU) was created to generate high-quality radio source classifications for training deep learning models and cataloging millions of radio sources in the southern sky. By integrating novel machine learning techniques, including anomaly detection and natural language processing, our workflow actively engages citizen scientists to enhance classification accuracy. We present results from Phase I of the project and discuss how these data will contribute to improving open science catalogues like EMUCAT.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We perform a comprehensive cosmographic analysis of Friedmann cosmologies modified by non-extensive entropy frameworks, focusing on Tsallis, R\&#39;enyi, and Kaniadakis entropies within a novel modified energy-momentum tensor approach. In our approach the microscopic matter density remains $\rho=m~n$ while the horizon thermodynamics of non-extensive entropy modifies the effective source that drives expansion, $\rho_{eff}=f(\rho)\rho$ which reduces to the standard case for $f(\rho)=1$. By deriving the generalized Friedmann equations for each entropy type, we calculate analytical expressions for key cosmographic parameters, including the deceleration ($q_0$), jerk ($j_0$), snap ($s_0$), and lerk ($l_0$) parameters, and examine their behavior compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results reveal significant differences between the traditional formal approach and the modified energy-momentum approach, particularly in the Tsallis model where cosmographic parameters and the dimensionless Hubble function $E(z)$ show notable deviations for deformation parameters away from unity. Moreover, both R\&#39;enyi and Kaniadakis models exhibit increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at higher redshifts, while remaining similar at low redshifts. Importantly, given the persistent $\sim5\sigma$ Hubble tension between local and global measurements, our analysis indicates that the flexibility of the modified entropic cosmology framework to alter the expansion rate could potentially alleviate this discrepancy by modifying the effective expansion history in a way compatible with observations. Future work will involve full Bayesian analyses with Pantheon+, DESI, and Planck data to further assess the viability of these models in resolving current cosmological tensions.</div>

Within a general formalism, we derive the effective potential in terms of the relevant cosmological parameters and the Rastall parameter for these gravity frameworks. As a specific example, we analyze the attractor $n_s(N) - 1 \propto N^{-1}$, first by considering constant values of the Rastall parameter to reconstruct the inflationary stage in standard Rastall gravity, and then by assuming a linear dependence on the number of $e-$folds $N$ to reconstruct the inflationary model in generalized Rastall gravity. Thus, the reconstruction of the potential $V(\phi)$ is obtained for both standard and generalized Rastall gravity inflationary models. In both frameworks, we constrain key parameters of the reconstructed models during inflation using the latest observational data from Planck.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The next generation of electron-positron colliders will require unprecedented precision in both theory and experiment. Sophisticated software frameworks are essential to evaluate detector concepts, optimize designs, and simulating physical processes. In this context, Monte Carlo (MC) event generators play a central role, enabling realistic simulations of Standard Model processes and providing the basis for physics studies. However, technical consistency across different generators remains critical, particularly in domains where agreement is expected. To address this need, we present K4GeneratorsConfig, a Python-based package that automates the benchmarking process for MC generators. The tool translates universal physics inputs into generator-specific configurations, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and reduced human error. Its modular design allows for straightforward integration of additional generators, supports batch processing, and provides compatibility with the Key4hep software stack</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neutrino-pair exchange induces a neutrino force that can drive dark matter (DM) self-interactions and impact small-scale structure formation. In the presence of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), this force can be modified, with important consequences for DM phenomenology. We study the effect of the C$\nu$B on neutrino forces, generated by the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions. We explore the significance of the background neutrino force on the scalar DM-neutrino portal model, including DM self-scattering and annihilation. Our results show that the interplay between attractive vacuum potential and repulsive background potential leads to a screening effect that varies across DM mass ($m_\chi$) regimes, strongly affecting DM self-scattering in the DM mass $m_\nu \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim T_{C \nu B}$. By contrast, the impact on DM annihilation is negligible. Overall, the C$\nu$B substantially reshapes the viable coupling range for DM self-interactions while remaining compatible with current constraints, offering a pathway to small-scale structure problems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M_B$ does not evolve with redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1 at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII] 88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line, continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy ($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a disk galaxy at a later stage.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the &#34;DARKSKIES&#34; suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}&gt;5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z&lt;0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.</div>

Our analysis reveals that the creation field coupling constant $(f)$ is always positive within the Narlikar gravity model from OHD+PP data sets. The best-fit estimates yield $ H_0 = 71.2 \pm 2.1 \text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\xi_0 = 0.23$, quoted at the $1 \sigma$ level. The Narlikar gravity model predicts a transition redshift of $z_t \approx 0.63$ marking the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration, with the corresponding age of the Universe estimated as $13.50\pm1.80 Gyr$. Interestingly, the inferred higher value of $H_0$, relative to SH0ES determinations, suggests a possible alleviation of the $\sim 4.1\sigma$ Hubble tension. Furthermore, we assess the stability of the model and demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be consistently explained through the energy conditions. This model retains dynamical flexibility while ensuring analytical tractability and provides a promising framework to investigate the cosmological implications of Hoyle-Narlikar gravity, particularly regarding late-time acceleration and the evolution of dark energy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth&#39;s core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.</div>

In this work, we investigate the interaction between a gravitational signal from an EMRI and millions of signals from inspiralling Galactic white dwarf binaries. We demonstrate that bright Galactic binaries contaminate the detection and characterization of EMRIs.

Within the Multiple Instance Learning paradigm, classifiers trained on these topological descriptors demonstrate significantly improved classification accuracy compared to the conventional ML approaches based on event-wise kinematic inputs. We also draw exclusion contours at 95\% CL in the $(m_{Z^\prime}, m_\chi)$ parameter space, highlighting the potential of topological features to extend the discovery reach of future collider experiments.</div>

We then analyze how this phase difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless, while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters via quantum interferometric techniques.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model&#39;s initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHS), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle&#39;s field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a re-projection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.</div>

However, the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on larger scales and more challenging domains.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive analysis of high-temperature vacuum decay and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background within the framework of general scale-invariant models. The effective potential is constructed to include tree-level contributions, the Coleman-Weinberg correction, finite-temperature effects, and the Daisy resummation technique, culminating in a high-temperature form. We investigate the dynamics of the first-order phase transition, calculating the critical and nucleation temperatures, the supercooling parameter, and the key transition parameters $\alpha$ (transition strength) and $\beta$ (inverse duration). The vacuum decay is found to be dominated by sphaleron transitions rather than quantum tunneling. We compute the full GW spectrum arising from bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. An extensive numerical scan reveals two distinct phenomenological regimes: one produces nanohertz-frequency GW signals potentially detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), while the other yields millihertz-frequency signals that are prime targets for future space-based interferometers like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</div>

Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\&#39;enic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\&#39;enic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a &#39;&#39;learn first, observe later&#39;&#39; paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents&#39; kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Taiji mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection employs laser interferometry to measure picometer-scale distance variations induced by GWs. The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise sources that might reduce Taiji&#39;s sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics simulation incorporating Taiji&#39;s drag-free and attitude control system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward realizing Taiji&#39;s full sensitivity.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.</div>

In this paper we introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hydrogen recombination lines are key diagnostics of ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), particularly within photoionized nebulae. Hydrodynamical simulations, even those that include radiative transfer, do not usually determine the level population of hydrogen required to compute line intensities, but rather interpolate them from pre-computed tables. Here we present the HyLight atomic model, which captures the dominant processes governing the level populations, enabling the calculation of all dipole-allowed hydrogen transitions as well as two-photon transitions from the 2s to 1s state without the need to pre-computed tables. We compare HyLight predictions to those of other codes and published tables, finding differences between the various rates of up to factors of several per cent for common transitions, including those of the Balmer and Brackett series. However, we find sub-per cent agreement between HyLight and the Cloudy spectral synthesis code when enforcing photo-ionisation equilibrium in gas under typical nebular conditions of density and temperature. Importantly, HyLight can also predict emissivities if the gas is not in photo-ionisation equilibrium. As examples, we compute the ratios between the total photoionization rate and line intensities in a nebula, and post-process a snapshot from Sparcs, a hydrodynamical code that combines radiative transfer with non-equilibrium physics, and compute mock hydrogen emission line maps which can be compared directly to observations. Implemented in Python, HyLight is an accurate tool for determining the level population in neutral hydrogen, a crucial step in bridging the gap between simulations and observations in studies of photoionized regions in galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI&#39;s capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model&#39;s true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gas accretion from both the circum-galactic medium (CGM)/inter-galatic medium (IGM) and interacting companion galaxy can dilute the gas phase metallicity of a galaxy. However, their relative contribution to the chemical evolution of galaxies remains to be quantified. To this end, in this work we study a sample of 510 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) having anomalously low-metallicity (ALM) regions selected from the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. ALM regions are defined as those having gas phase metallicities that are at least $\sim 2\sigma$ lower than the emprical relation between stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_{*}$) and gas phase metallicity, i.e., the $\Sigma_{*}-Z$ relation. We find that ALM galaxies have higher star formation rates and \Hi~gas fractions than normal SFGs at fixed $M_*$. $\sim$25\% of the ALM galaxies exhibit tidal features, while the tidal fraction is only $\sim$12\% for normal SFGs, indicating that galaxy interaction is an important factor responsible for the ALM phenomenon. To explore the origin of non-tidal ALM galaxies, we compare their morphologies and environments with those of mass-matched normal SFGs. We find that non-tidal ALM galaxies tend to have more disk-dominated morphologies and reside in less-dense environment. These findings suggest that cold gas accretion from the CGM/IGM is the primary cause for the ALM phenomenon, while galaxy interaction plays a minor but non-negligible role.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC) supergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star formation history of the Milky Way&#39;s Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies have reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the chemical evolution of this unique region. Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant GCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance analyses. Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed using contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from scandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to accurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium. Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06 $\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower than previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance by approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with recent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling. Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22 suggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type II supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings support a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent bursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas inflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future comprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for refining our understanding of the region&#39;s chemical evolution and star formation history.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption&#39;&#39; stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.</div>

We derived explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case of a DE Dominated Universe. To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated several diagnostic tools, namely the Statefinder parameters, the cosmographic approach, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ to assess stability against perturbations. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld, Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark matter decays into invisible particles can leave an imprint in large-scale structure surveys due to a characteristic redshift-dependent suppression of the power spectrum. We present a model with two quasi-degenerate singlet fermions, $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, in which the heavier state decays as $\chi_2 \to \bar \chi_1 \nu \nu$ on cosmological time-scales, and that also accommodates non-zero neutrino masses. Remarkably, for parameters that yield the correct dark matter abundance via freeze-in and reproduce the observed neutrino masses, dark matter decay can produce detectable signals in forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, a diffuse anti-neutrino flux accessible to JUNO, and a gamma-ray line within the energy range probed by COSI. Both the cosmological lifetime of $\chi_2$ as well as the small (radiatively induced) mass splitting among $\chi_{1,2}$ are a natural consequence of the mechanism of neutrino mass generation within this model. This highlights the potential role of large-scale structure surveys in probing some classes of neutrino mass models.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its formation to the present day. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} mission along with supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising sequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion correlating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion coincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day expansion rate of about 10--12\,pc\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star clusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older ones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion and spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star formation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly suggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen&#39;s star formation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize the value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB associations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution age maps.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper investigates the gravastar model as a potential alternative to black holes, utilizing the Kuchowicz metric in the context of Rastall gravity. The model comprises three distinct regions: an interior with positive energy density and negative pressure, a thin intermediate shell made of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, and an exterior vacuum. The negative pressure within the interior generates an outward force exerted on the shell, fulfilling the Zel&#39;dovich criterion. This configuration eliminates the central singularity and replaces the event horizon with the shell. We then derive the radial metric functions for both the inner and thin region, yielding a non-singular solution. Furthermore, we examine the physical properties of the shell, such as its energy, proper length, entropy, equation of state parameter, gravitational redshift and adiabatic index, across a range of Rastall parameter values. We conclude that the resulting gravastar model offers a promising solution to the singularity problem of conventional black holes within the context of this non-conservative theory.</div>

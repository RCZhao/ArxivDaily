                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Observations of the large-scale structure (LSS) provide a powerful test of gravity on cosmological scales, but high-resolution N-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) are prohibitively expensive. We present MG-NECOLA, a convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1% accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \simeq 1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies in upcoming surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The evolution of galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and their external environments. Galaxy clusters and their surroundings provide ideal laboratories to study these effects, particularly mechanisms such as quenching and morphological transformation. The Chilean Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES) Low-z sub-survey is part of the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, a 4MOST community survey designed to uncover the relationship between the formation and evolution of galaxies and hierarchical structure formation as it happens, through deep and wide multi-object spectroscopy. We present the target selection strategy followed to select galaxy cluster candidate members for the CHANCES low-z sub-survey, in and around 50 clusters and two superclusters at z= 500,000 galaxy cluster candidate members and including confirmed spectroscopic galaxy cluster members, from which we expect to obtain 4MOST low-resolution (R~6500) spectra for ~320,000 galaxies. The CHANCES Low-z target catalogues form a statistically robust sample for spectroscopic follow-up, allowing studies of galaxy evolution and environmental effects in nearby cluster and supercluster environments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5&lt;z&lt;7$. Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$ $\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.</div>

Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole&#39;s information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole&#39;s master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos. In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters offers particularly rare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant ($z\gtrsim2$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent outstanding example is the Type Ia SN &#34;H0pe&#34; ($z=1.78$), discovered in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a new strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple images of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of constraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface brightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model parameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the spatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the position of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction estimate at $\lesssim1\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on spectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model of G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the image plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a relatively high extinction of $A_V \approx 0.9\ {\rm mag}$ at around $\sim 1\ {\rm kpc}$ from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling in lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model parameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host galaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in future cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The physically motivated definition of galaxy size proposed recently, linked to the farther location of the in-situ star formation, considerably reduces the scatter of the galaxy mass-size relation, and provide a viable method to infer the galaxy stellar mass from its size. We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations, and computed the size of galaxies and their mass mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation&#39;s normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size, and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than observed. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with great accuracy (less than fifty percent, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments aim to detect primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Effective foreground removal is essential to avoid biases in the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in this high-precision regime. Recent analyses highlight the unexpected complexity of synchrotron emission at low frequencies, underscoring the need for more sensitive low-frequency data. To address this challenge, the European Low-Frequency Survey (ELFS) initiative and the Simons Array collaboration propose installing two European low-frequency receivers on one of the Simons Array telescopes. These receivers will enable measurements in the Southern Hemisphere between $6$ and $20$,GHz, complementary to those of current and proposed experiments targeting the measurement of cosmological gravitational waves. In this work, we study the benefits of combining these low-frequency observations with a representative future CMB experiment operating from the Southern Hemisphere. We find that the extra information can improve the knowledge of the underlying synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED), with positive impacts on the robustness of measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, against the complexity of low-frequency foregrounds.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model&#39;s compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens have the potential to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ in the local universe independently of the distance ladder, and thus offer unique new insights into the Hubble tension. A key challenge with standard sirens is detecting their electromagnetic counterparts, and therefore assigning redshifts to the measured distances. One promising way to proceed is to utilize GW `dark sirens&#39; -- events without an identified electromagnetic counterpart -- and cross-correlate their angular distribution with that of galaxies. We present a quantitative study of how precisely the Hubble constant can be measured using tomographic cross-correlation between galaxies and GW sources. Overall, we find that the constraints on $H_0$ will be limited by the quality and quantity of GW data. We find that percent-level constraints on $H_0$ will primarily depend on achieving small distance uncertainties ($\sigma_{d_L}=0.1\,d_L$), obtaining a large number of GW dark sirens ($\gtrsim$$5{,}000$), and accurate sky localization in the tomographic analysis.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep, wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a galaxy in relatively short time ($\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention. The FAST-SBF tool is planned for public release to support the community in using SBF as a distance indicator in next-generation surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s &gt; 1$ yields performance improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.</div>

In this work, we investigate the statistical constraints on anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology within the framework of f(R,T) gravity. The specific choice $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ is considered and exact solutions are derived for the background dynamics of the model. The physical parameters, such as the Hubble parameter H(z), spatial volume V(z), energy density $\rho(z)$, and pressure p(z), are derived and their evolutionary behaviors are analyzed. To examine the observational viability of the model, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis using the latest observational datasets, including the Hubble parameter measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae. The combined data analysis provides constraints on the free parameters of the model and allows a comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments aim to achieve high-precision reconstruction of the CMB polarization signal, with the most ambitious objective being the detection of primordial $B$ modes sourced by cosmic inflation. Given the expected low amplitude of the signal, its estimate, parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, is highly susceptible to contamination from Galactic foreground residuals that remain after component separation. In this work, we introduce an agnostic, model-independent procedure to construct a spectral template of residual foreground contamination in the observed angular power spectrum. Specifically, a cleaned multifrequency set of foreground-emission maps is blindly reconstructed from the observed data using the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) technique. These maps are then combined with the weights adopted for CMB reconstruction, yielding an estimate of the spatial distribution of foreground residuals after component separation. The power spectrum of this residual map, after proper noise debiasing, is incorporated into the spectral model of the cosmological likelihood, thereby enabling unbiased inference of cosmological parameters. We validate the method on realistic simulations of a LiteBIRD-like experiment, focusing on constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We demonstrate that including the residual template in the likelihood yields unbiased estimates of $r$, regardless of its input value, the assumed foreground model, or the adopted masking strategy, thus proving the robustness of the proposed procedure. The pipeline has been made publicly available as part of the BROOM Python package (https://github.com/alecarones/broom).</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We develop a highly accurate analytic approximation for small-scale non-cold relic perturbations by solving the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the quasi-stationary regime. The approximation is implemented in CLASSIER (CLASS Integral Equation Revision), a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS that replaces the traditional truncated Boltzmann hierarchy of non cold relic multipoles with a small set of integral equations solved iteratively. Applying it to massive neutrinos yields a factor-of-two reduction in total runtime relative to CLASSIER without the approximation. Compared to standard CLASS runs (with $\ell_{\rm max}^{\rm NCDM}=40$ and no late-time massive neutrino fluid approximation) under the same precision setting, CLASSIER with this approximation is faster by a factor of 3-6. The approximation faithfully reproduces the late-time behavior of massive neutrino perturbations and preserves sub-$0.1\%$ accuracy in the matter power spectrum today up to comoving wavenumber $k=100\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this approximation, massive-neutrino perturbations are no longer the computational bottleneck on small scales for linear-theory predictions. The approach can be readily extendable to non-standard dark-matter models, and offers prospects for further efficiency gains in high-precision cosmological analyses.</div>

The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive forecast for cosmological constraints using the joint observation of the cosmic shear signal from the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) and the clustering signal from the next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detector networks, e.g. Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST&#39;s weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.</div>

That is, we create mock, or synthetic, absorption spectra by drawing lines-of-sight through cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, using a new mesh-free Voronoi ray-tracing algorithm. The result is the Synthetic Absorption Line Spectral Almanac (SALSA), which is publicly released on a feature-rich online science platform (www.tng-project.org/spectra). It spans a range of ions, transitions, instruments, observational characteristics, assumptions, redshifts, and simulations. These include, but are not limited to: (ions) HI, OI, CI, MgI, MgII, FeII, SiII, CaII, ZnII, SiIII, SiIV, NV, CII, CIV, OVI; (instruments) SDSS-BOSS, KECK-HIRES, UVES, COS, DESI, 4MOST, WEAVE, XSHOOTER; (model choices) with/without dust depletion, noise, quasar continua, foregrounds; (redshift) from z=0 to z~6; (ancillary data) integrated equivalent widths, column densities, distances and properties of nearby galaxies; (simulations) IllustrisTNG including TNG50, TNG-Cluster, EAGLE, and SIMBA. This scope is not fixed, and will grow and evolve with community interest and requests over time -- suggestions are welcome.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">According to the perturbed Friedmann model, the difference between Hubble constant measurements in two rest frames, at leading order in velocity, is determined solely by the relative motion of the observers and remains unaffected by the peculiar velocities of the sources. This implies that, when averaging over a sufficiently large and distant set of sources where local nonlinear inhomogeneities are diminished, such a difference should vanish, so that the Hubble flow is statistically uniform, as predicted by the Cosmological Principle -- a core assumption of the standard cosmological paradigm. In previous works, distance measurement compilations, e.g. the CosmicFlows-3 catalogue, were used for this purpose, as it comprises a large number ($\sim 10^4$) of sources of different types. Due to the increasing amount of precise luminosity distance measurements of Type Ia Supenovae (SNe) in the last few years, in this work we investigate whether we can confirm the uniformity of the Hubble flow with low-$z$ SN distances only. By means of the Pantheon+ and SH0ES compilation, we find that the results align well with previous works based on the CF3 catalogue, and are in good agreement with the expected Hubble variance in the standard model across cosmic scales of $20-150$ Mpc. Notably, the Hubble constant difference $\Delta H_0 \approx 0$ is observed at around $85$ Mpc. Despite the smaller sample size ($\sim 10^2$ versus $\sim 10^4$) relative to CF3 at those scales, our analysis show that the Pantheon+ and SH0ES dataset supports the standard model paradigm, which indicates that the Hubble flow becomes statistically uniform at around $70-100$ Mpc, which is compatible with independent determinations of the homogeneity scale based on galaxy number counts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">High-redshift protoclusters are crucial for understanding the formation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond $z&gt;$10. Among JWST surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area $\sim$0.27 deg$^2$, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study, we searched for protoclusters at $z\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as $\sim25\%$. Overdensities ($\delta$) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\pm$0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of $M_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The peculiar motions of massive halos probe the distribution of matter in the universe, the gravitational potential, and the history of cosmic structure growth. The kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect offers a robust observational window into these properties. The pairwise kSZ estimator probes the pairwise momentum of groups of galaxies by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps with spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, using galaxies to trace the positions of dark matter halos. This note introduces iskay2, an efficient pipeline designed to apply the pairwise kSZ estimator to maps of the CMB and large galaxy catalogs. Pairwise kSZ measurements obtained using this pipeline are compared to previously published results and are shown to be consistent within statistical expectations. This pipeline will enable high-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ utilizing galaxy catalogs like DESI combined with past, current and next-generation high-resolution CMB experiments such as ACT, SPT and the Simons Observatory.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Strong gravitational lensing of active galactic nuclei (AGN) enables measurements of cosmological parameters through time-delay cosmography (TDC). With data from the upcoming LSST survey, we anticipate using a sample of O(1000) lensed AGN for TDC. To prepare for this dataset and enable this measurement, we construct and analyze a realistic mock sample of 1300 systems drawn from the OM10 (Oguri &amp; Marshall 2010) catalog of simulated lenses with AGN sources at $z&lt;3.1$ in order to test a key aspect of the analysis pipeline, that of the lens modeling. We realize the lenses as power law elliptical mass distributions and simulate 5-year LSST i-band coadd images. From every image, we infer the lens mass model parameters using neural posterior estimation (NPE). Focusing on the key model parameters, $\theta_E$ (the Einstein Radius) and $\gamma_{lens}$ (the projected mass density profile slope), with consistent mass-light ellipticity correlations in test and training data, we recover $\theta_E$ with less than 1% bias per lens, 6.5% precision per lens and $\gamma_{lens}$ with less than 3% bias per lens, 8% precision per lens. We find that lens light subtraction prior to modeling is only useful when applied to data sampled from the training prior. If emulated deconvolution is applied to the data prior to modeling, precision improves across all parameters by a factor of 2. Finally, we combine the inferred lens mass models using Bayesian Hierarchical Inference to recover the global properties of the lens sample with less than 1% bias.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ground-based transmission spectroscopy is often dominated by systematics, which obstructs our ability to leverage the advantages of larger aperture sizes compared to space-based observations. These systematics could be time-correlated, uniform across all spectroscopic light curves, or wavelength-correlated, which could significantly affect the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Gaussian Processes were introduced in transmission spectroscopy by Gibson et al. (2012) to model correlated systematics in a non-parametric way. The technique uses auxiliary information about the observation and independently fits each spectroscopic light curve to provide robust atmospheric retrievals. However, this method assumes that the uncertainties in the transmission spectrum are uncorrelated in wavelength, which can cause discrepancies and degrade the precision of atmospheric retrievals. To address this limitation, we explore a 2D GP framework formulated by Fortune et al. (2024) to simultaneously model time- and wavelength-correlated systematics. We present its application to ground-based observations of TOI-4153b obtained using the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). As we move towards detecting smaller and cooler planets, developing new methods to address complex systematics becomes increasingly essential.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The strengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm Halo}$), and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations, but in TNG, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$M_{\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the correlations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly correlate with $M_{\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve MLP&#39;s performance. $M_{\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy properties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations are fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and validate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias&#39;, caused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\ell \lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer function to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to produce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and demonstrate that it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the publicly available code NaMaster.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The apparent shadow of a black hole provides one of the most direct probes of strong-field general relativity. While the shadow size in asymptotically flat spacetimes is well understood, the influence of cosmic expansion on its apparent angular diameter remains less explored. In this work, we present a simple analytic framework to estimate the shadow size of a non-rotating black hole embedded in an expanding universe. By combining the local Schwarzschild geometry with large-scale cosmological dynamics through the McVittie and Kottler metrics, we derive a compact relation between the shadow angular size and the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. This approach captures the essential dependence on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, while remaining analytically tractable. We further perform numerical estimates to quantify the redshift dependence of the apparent shadow size, showing that the effect of cosmic expansion is negligible for nearby sources but becomes relevant for high-redshift black holes. Our results demonstrate a clear conceptual connection between strong-gravity optics and cosmological expansion, providing a pedagogically transparent and physically motivated extension of black hole shadow theory to a cosmological context.</div>

Many methods for unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding using machine learning have been proposed, but no generative method scales to the several hundred dimensions necessary to fully characterize LHC collisions. This paper proposes a 3-stage generative unfolding framework that is capable of unfolding several hundred dimensions. It is effective to unfold the jet-level kinematics as well as the full substructure of light-flavor jets and of top jets, and is the first generative unfolding study to achieve high precision on high-dimensional jet substructure.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The gravitational weak lensing of neutrinos in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo is investigated. The event horizon structure is explored, and the existence of the BH is studied in two different slices of the parameter space. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the oscillation phase and transition probabilities for both radial and non-radial neutrino propagation. Finally, we use a two-flavor toy model, and numerically analyze how the dark matter halo parameters as density and scale radius, affect oscillation probabilities and examine the role of decoherence. The results show that the presence of a dark matter halo modifies the oscillation phase and damping factor, leading to measurable deviations from the standard Schwarzschild BH case. These findings suggest that neutrino oscillations could, in principle, serve as a probe for dark matter distributions around compact astrophysical objects.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.</div>

These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins &amp; Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, &#34;and yet they are not found&#34; - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.</div>

Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark matter environments.</div>

Several phenomenological parameters were extracted from a combined fit to precision data on the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ collected by the BCDMS, H1, and ZEUS Collaborations, comprising a total of 933 points from 5 datasets. We proposed a model for nuclear medium modifications of parton densities. The approach is based on a global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model, incorporating Fermi motion effects. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio $F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^{D}(x,Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$, we obtained predictions for nuclear parton distribution functions.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar radial migration has predominantly been examined in isolated disc galaxies where non-axisymmetric structures drive the process. By contrast, while tidal interactions are known for having an influence, their contribution remains comparatively under explored. The LMC, the nearest disc galaxy to the Milky Way (MW) and currently interacting with the SMC, provides a unique laboratory to investigate this interplay. We aim to quantify the impact of tidal interactions on radial migration and metallicity distribution in high-resolution simulations of LMC-like disc galaxies. We leverage a subsample of KRATOS, a suite of 28 pure $N$-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system. Specifically, we use 6 simulations of both isolated and interacting LMC-like galaxies, exploring different values of the Toomre stellar parameter $Q$. These simulations allow to map the evolution of the stars&#39; guiding radii $R_g(t)$ and compute radial migration fluxes in interacting systems and compare with their isolated counterparts, allowing to quantify the link between tidal interactions, radial migration, non-axisymmetric patterns, disc internal stability, and radial metallicity distribution. We present tidally-triggered wave-like radial migration fluxes reaching up to $\sim40\%$ of disc stellar mass per Gyr. This wave-like migration appears during the satellite&#39;s pericentre passages, almost independently of $Q$ and induces a metallicity drop of $\sim$3-5\% of the isolated galaxy&#39;s maximum metallicity in the inner disc. Additionally, in the isolated simulations, the extent of variation in the bar&#39;s resonance region coincides with the mixing zones in the metallicity distribution. We propose a novel description of a wave-like radial migration flux as a dynamical response of a galaxy undergoing tidal interactions and sketch its impact on the galaxy&#39;s metallicity distribution.</div>

We present niebla, the first open-source code to compute the EBL using a forward-folding approach that accepts fully customizable inputs. This software enables a detailed modelling of the influence of EBL opacities on VHE observations and facilitates the distinction between different dust reemission models. The code models the optical background primarily from stellar emission, by evolving the spectrum of a single stellar population as a function of redshift, considering mean metallicity evolution and star formation rate density. Additional sources to the EBL can be provided by the user. The code already includes optional contributions from, e.g., stripped stars, intra-halo light, or the decay of axion dark matter. The optical emissivity is then absorbed by interstellar dust and reemitted in the infrared regime. We provide multiple prescriptions to model this process, using spectral dust templates or a combination of blackbodies. We provide three EBL models calculated with different dust reemission prescriptions, which have been fitted to various observational data sets. In addition, we showcase the versatility of our model through a simulated observation of the blazar Markarian 501 in a high-flux state with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory array. We find that the simulated VHE spectrum is highly sensitive to the EBL opacity coming from the infrared. Our model will therefore allow the community to distinguish between different dust reemission models and constrain EBL parameters with future observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We begin our journey by recalling the fundamentals of Probability Theory that underlie one of its most significant applications to real-world problems: Parametric Estimation. Throughout the text, we systematically develop this theme by presenting and discussing the main tools it encompasses (concentration inequalities, limit theorems, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood, least squares, and hypothesis testing) always with an eye toward both their theoretical underpinnings and practical relevance. While our approach follows the broad contours of conventional expositions, we depart from tradition by consistently exploring the geometric aspects of probability, particularly the invariance properties of normally distributed random vectors. This geometric perspective is taken further in an extended appendix, where we introduce the rudiments of Brownian motion and the corresponding stochastic calculus, culminating in It\^o&#39;s celebrated change-of-variables formula. To highlight its scope and elegance, we present some of its most striking applications: the sharp Gaussian concentration inequality (a central example of the &#34;concentration of measure phenomenon&#34;), the Feynman-Kac formula (used to derive a path integral representation for the Laplacian heat kernel), and, as a concluding delicacy, the Black-Scholes strategy in Finance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</div>

Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one&#39;s expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the main analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy. By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound that applies to all incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be established even in the degenerate case and when the order diverges. We also introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain cases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to kernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. In a real data example with CIFAR-10, our permutation-free MMD test delivers substantial computational gains while retaining power and type I error control.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the {\Lambda}CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This article presents the first part of a study aimed at testing the unification paradigm for AGN (UPAGN) using the SED reconstruction code X-CIGALE. Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of Seyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II), expecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$, relative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad line regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low redshifts, $ z&lt;0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the presence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and AGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\% of the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen face-on ($i \sim 10^\circ \pm 5^\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the existence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new facts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of matter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from the wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this structure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as AGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity in their past.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases. Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.</div>

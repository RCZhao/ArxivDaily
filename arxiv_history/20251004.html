                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We employ a model-independent approach in both the correlation function estimation and the angular BAO feature estimation by computing the angular two-point correlation function. First, we conducted a series of tests to the available DESI tracers to check their representativeness to angular clustering; the result was that, considering the completeness of the first data release across the footprint, we could only make use of the BGS sample for the effective redshifts 0.21 (BGS1) and 0.25 (BGS2). For a reliable analysis in such low redshift, we consider Lagrangian Perturbation Theory at first order on our mocks, which approximately reproduces the expected non-linearities, and generate the corresponding random catalogues. We use a purely statistical method to correct the projection effects and find that our results show reasonable agreement with the $\theta_{\rm BAO}$ expected by the CPL parameters obtained by DESI DR1, being BGS1 $11.78 \pm 1.12$ degrees and BGS2 $11.81 \pm 1.20$ degrees. This means a tension at the $1.5\sigma$ ($2.6\sigma$) level for BGS1 (BGS2) CPL parametrization, while a $2\sigma$ ($3.3\sigma$) discrepancy within the predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. We conclude that, with the current sample available, the use of an angular correlation function serving as the BAO probe, although prefers the CPL parametrization, does not provide conclusive results regarding the best cosmological model.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar streams are sensitive tracers of low-mass dark matter subhalos and provide a means to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm on small scales. In this work, we connect the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream to the number density and internal structure of dark matter subhalos in the mass range $10^5$-$10^9\ M_\odot$. We measure the radial velocity dispersion of GD-1 based on 160 identified member stars across four different spectroscopic catalogs. We use repeat observations of the same stars to constrain binarity. We find that the stream&#39;s intrinsic radial velocity dispersion ranges from approximately 2-5 km/s across its length. The region of GD-1 with the highest velocity dispersion represents a $4\sigma$ deviation from unperturbed stream models formed in a smooth Milky Way potential, which are substantially colder. We use perturbation theory to model the stream&#39;s velocity dispersion as a function of dark matter subhalo population parameters, including the number of low-mass subhalos in the Milky Way, the dark matter half-mode mass, and the mass-concentration relation of subhalos. We find that the observed velocity dispersion can be explained by numerous impacts with low-mass dark matter subhalos, or by a single impact with a very compact subhalo with $M \gtrsim 10^8\ M_\odot$. Our constraint on the fraction of mass in subhalos is $f_{\mathrm{sub}} = 0.05^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ (68\% confidence). In both scenarios, our model prefers subhalos that are more compact compared to CDM mass-size expectations. These results suggest a possible deviation from CDM at low subhalo masses, which may be accounted for by dark matter self-interactions that predict higher concentrations in lower-mass subhalos.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The perturbation spectra of black hole (BH) beyond standard general relativity (GR) may exhibit complex structures with long-lived modes that generate echo-like modulations on the ringdown signal. However, a systematic framework for understanding the internal structure of such spectra, the physical nature of different mode families, and their dynamical excitation is still undeveloped. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a potential methodology that combines frequency-domain classification with time-domain analysis, using a hairy Schwarzschild BH that admits a double-peak perturbative potential as a theoretical platform. Our analysis of the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the photon sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and the echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then develop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which discloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families. In particular, our results explicitly show that this competition is sensitive to the properties of the initial perturbation source, and that higher-overtone echo modes can dominate in the observed signal, which are in contrast to the standard PS mode in GR. This study establishes the dynamic evolution of this energy competition as a new observational signature for probing new physics and further motivate a supplemental framework for analyzing long-lived ringdown signals.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.</div>

In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory&#39;s LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass. In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, S\&#39;ersic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \texttt{photomass\_ls.py} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\%. For both\,--\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The existence of a large primordial neutrino asymmetry is an intriguing possibility, both observationally and theoretically. Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$\,keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a first analysis of the dynamics of in-situ globular clusters (GCs) in Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies embedded in fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, combining cosmological assembly histories from the TNG50 simulation with dedicated orbital integrations and analytical models. GC populations are initialized with identical distributions in normalized $E$-$L_{z}$ in matched CDM and FDM halos. In a universe dominated by FDM, we identify three distinct regimes for the in-situ GC population depending on the particle mass $m_{22} \equiv m_{\chi}/ 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$. For $m_{22} 7$, the dark matter becomes both compact and globally dominant, generating a deeper and more extended gravitational potential that supports a wider range of stable GC orbits, resulting in more massive and spatially extended GC systems. Finally, we extend our framework to make predictions for GC populations in alternative DM models, including warm dark matter and self-interacting dark matter, in both MW-like and dwarf galaxies. Our findings demonstrate that in-situ GC systems offer a sensitive and independent probe of the underlying DM physics, opening new avenues for observational constraints with upcoming Euclid.</div>

We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The ADF22 line survey reported detections of two high-$z$ line-emitting source candidates above 6-$\sigma$, both of which were shown to be spurious after follow-up observations. We investigate the detectability of far-infrared emitters in ALMA deep fields using mock observations by injecting artificial line-emitting sources into the visibility planes. We also discuss our investigation, conducted together with the ALMA operations team, of a possible technical problem in the original observations. Finally, we devise a method to estimate the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 6$, including a full analysis of signal contamination and sample completeness. The comparison of pixel distributions between the real and mock datacubes does not show significant differences, confirming that the effect of non-Gaussian noise is negligible for the ADF22 datacube. Using 100 blank mock-mosaic datasets, we show 0.43 $\pm$ 0.67 false detections per datacube with the previous source-finding method. We argue that the underestimation of the contamination rate in the previous work is caused by the smaller number of datacubes, using only 4 real ADF22 datacubes. We compare the results of clump-finding between the time division mode and frequency division mode correlator datacubes and confirm that the velocity widths of the clumps in the TDM case are up to 3 times wider than in the FDM case. The LF estimation using our model shows that a correction for the number count is required, up to one order of magnitude, in the luminosity range of $\geq 5 \times 10^8 L_\odot$. Our reconstruction method for the line LF can be applied to future blind line surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We model the impact of source confusion on photometry and the resulting spectrophotometric redshifts for SPHEREx, a NASA Medium-Class Explorer that is carrying out an all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. Spectral confusion from untargeted background galaxies degrades sensitivity and introduces a spectral bias. Using interpolated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we construct a Monte Carlo library of confusion spectra that captures the cumulative impact from faint galaxies. By injecting confusion realizations into galaxy SEDs and performing forced photometry at known source positions, we quantify photometric and redshift error and bias. For our current expected selection of sources for the cosmology analysis, we find typical 1-$\sigma$ confusion levels range from $0.8-3.8\ \mu\mathrm{Jy}$ across $0.75-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. While negligible at full-sky survey depth, spectral confusion becomes significant in the SPHEREx deep fields, reducing the number of intermediate-precision redshifts and inducing a small systematic overestimation in redshift. In parallel, we also model targeted source blending from beam overlaps, which contributes additional photometric noise without systematic redshift bias, provided that positions are known exactly. Together, confusion and blending vary with the depth of the selected reference sample, revealing a trade-off, where deeper selections reduce confusion but increase blending-induced noise. Our methodology informs optimization of the SPHEREx deep-field selection strategy and future treatments of stellar source blending and confusion.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low computational cost.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dark radiation (DR) is ubiquitous in physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and its interactions with the SM and dark matter (DM) lead to a variety of interesting effects on cosmological observables. However, even in scenarios where DR is &#39;secluded&#39;, i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM, it can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four different types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling, and recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary neutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to perform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR properties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant preference for physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit interesting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino energy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset prefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a significant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any evidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of the isocurvature power spectrum. Our analysis also highlights the degeneracy of various DR parameters with the Hubble constant $H_0$ resulting in a mild relaxation of the $H_0$ tension.</div>

More specifically, we employ the framework of Symmetry Preserving Attention Network (\textsc{Spa-Net}), which takes into account the permutational symmetry when a correct pairing of $b$-jets is achieved, to tackle both jet pairing and event classification. Significantly improved efficiency is achieved in signal and background discrimination. When comparing with the conventional Dense Neural Networks, \textsc{Spa-Net} results in up to 40\% more stringent limits on resonant production cross-sections. These results highlight the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques to significantly improve the sensitivity of triple Higgs boson searches in the fully hadronic channel.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxies with a disk morphology have been established at $z &gt; 9$ with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). However, confirming their disky nature requires studying their gas kinematics, which can be challenging when relying solely on the warm gas observed by JWST. Unlike the cold gas traced by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), warm gas is sensitive to outflows, complicating the interpretation of the disk dynamics. This elicits the question of how to compare information obtained from varied tracers, as well as how to physically interpret the low angular and spectral resolution observations generally available at high redshift. We address these challenges through comparative kinematic analysis of idealised and realistic NIRSpec/IFU mock observations derived from two galaxies in the SERRA suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. With these synthetic data, we determine the robustness of dynamical information recovered from typical IFU observations, and test widely-used criteria for identifying disks and gaseous outflows at high redshift. We find that at the typical NIRSpec/IFU spectral and angular resolution ($\sim$ 0.05&#34;/pixel), non-circular motions due to inflows or outflows can mimic the smooth velocity gradient indicative of a disk, and bias measured velocity dispersion upwards by a factor of $2-3\times$. As a result, the level of rotational support may be underestimated in the NIRSpec/IFU observations. However, the recovered dynamical mass appears to be relatively robust despite biases in $v_\text{rot}$ and $\sigma$.</div>

To assess the impact of these changes, we present running parameters obtained using both the 2022 and 2024 datasets, within the frameworks of the Standard Model (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM). The evolved values, along with their associated $1\sigma$ uncertainties, are given within the SM framework at benchmark scales of $M_Z$ and $10^3$, $3\cdot 10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$, $10^7$, $10^9$, $10^{12}$, and $10^{16}$ GeV. Within the MSSM, we additionally provide GUT-scale results for different choices of $\tan\beta$, assuming supersymmetry breaking scales of 3 and 10 TeV, including an approximate way for taking supersymmetric loop threshold corrections into account. We furthermore discuss implications of the updated results for constructing and testing theories beyond the SM.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Despite stringent constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, it is still possible for well-motivated particle physics models to substantially alter the cosmic expansion history between BBN and recombination. In this work we consider two different axion models that can realize a period of first matter domination, then kination, in this epoch. We perform fits to both primordial element abundances as well as CMB data and determine that up to a decade of late axion domination is allowed by these probes of the early universe. We establish the implications of late axion domination for the matter power spectrum on the scales $1/\mathrm{Mpc}\lesssim k \lesssim 10^3/$Mpc. Our &#39;log&#39; model predicts a relatively modest bump-like feature together with a small suppression relative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions on either side of the enhancement. Our &#39;two-field&#39; model predicts a larger, plateau-like feature that realizes enhancements to the matter power spectrum of up to two orders of magnitude. These features have interesting implications for structure formation at the forefront of current detection capabilities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality. The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels. Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD) suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in a variety of tasks.</div>

This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals.

In the present article, we derive probabilistic representations and integration by parts (IBP) formulas for expectations involving affine processes. These formulas are expressed in terms of expectations of affine processes with modified parameters and are derived using Fourier analytic techniques and characteristic functions. Notably, our method does not require pathwise differentiability, allowing us to handle models with square-root diffusion coefficients for a large set of parameters. The methodology can be applied to the classic Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) model, a model for interest rates in mathematical finance, where the initial value derivative corresponds to one of the ``Greeks&#39;&#39; used in option pricing in mathematical finance. Furthermore, we illustrate the theory with an application to a population evolution model arising as a scaling limit of discrete branching processes. Our approach offers a unified and robust framework for sensitivity analysis in models where classical Malliavin calculus techniques are difficult to apply.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">What triggers AGN in some galaxies and what role does this brief period of activity play in the overall evolution of galaxies are still open questions. This paper explores whether or not the local, on scales of $\approx$1\,Mpc, galaxy density plays a role in triggering AGN when controlling for stellar mass. We consider this question as a function of redshift and AGN selection in the X-ray vs. in the IR. We use available density maps within the 4.8\,sq.deg. XMM-LSS field in the redshift range $0.1 1.2$ the incidence of AGN increases in higher density environments, controlling for stellar mass. However, this dependence reverses at $z &lt; 1.2$ where the incidence of IR AGN is higher in lower density environments. By contrast, among X-ray selected AGN there is no significant local density dependence. Bootstraping analysis confirms these conclusions. While these results agree with previous work on both obscured and unobscured AGN this is the first study to use a consistent methodology across IR and X-ray samples, as well as study IR dependence in this full redshift range. Upcoming large spectroscopic surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) galaxy evolution survey will be critical in further elucidating how the environment affects AGN triggering across different cosmic epochs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this article, we prove the cutoff phenomenon for a general class of the discrete-time nonlinear recombination models. This system models the evolution of a probability measure on a finite product space $S^n$ representing the state of spins on $n$ sites. Although its stationary distribution has a product structure, and its evolution is Markovian, the dynamics of the model is nonlinear. Consequently, the estimation of the mixing time becomes a highly non-trivial task. The special case with two spins and homogeneous stationary measure was considered in Caputo, Labb\&#39;e, and Lacoin [The Annals of Applied Probability 35:1164-1197, 2025], where the cutoff phenomenon for the mixing behavior has been verified. In this article, we extend this result to the general case with finite spins and inhomogeneous stationary measure by developing a novel algebraic representation for the density fluctuation of the system with respect to its stationary state.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">High resolution, ultraviolet imaging is often unavailable across the sky, even in heavily studied fields such as the Chandra Deep Field - South. The Habitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the possibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in development to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of spectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter. This initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED fitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used by the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that the GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta parameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation age of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate the 2175\r{A} attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same feature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness of HWO&#39;s ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a FUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted. This will combine the power of GALEX&#39;s wavelength range with the finer sampling of UVOT around an important dust feature.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable, and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development, training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark, involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of predictive performance.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Milky Way&#39;s inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed. A qualitative comparison with the Auriga Superstars simulations suggesting a possible link to bar dynamics and satellite accretion. [Abridged]</div>

In our analysis we study the robustness of the bounds under uncertainties in key UFD parameters, such as the half-light radius, stellar velocity dispersion, total halo mass and dark matter and stellar density profiles. We apply this framework to both well-established UFD candidates, as well as the recently discovered UFD candidate Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. We find that multiple UFDs yield consistently strong limits in the mass range $10\, M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^9\, M_\odot$, underscoring the robustness of a previous analysis solely based on Segue I. We also demonstrate that Ursa Major III, if confirmed as an UFD, would improve the constraints significantly, providing the strongest constraints on MACHO dark matter in the mass range $1\, M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{\rm MACHO} \lesssim 10^5\, M_\odot$.</div>

We report a hybrid approach that takes advantage of Micron CXL hardware for the memory capacity intensive CC downfolding phase while employing AQE cloud computing for the less resource-intensive DMRG simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the scalable ExaChem suite of electronic simulations conducted on Micron prototype systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil&#39;s advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension &#34;no-go theorem&#34;, and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</div>

We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Oscillons are long-lived nonlinear pseudo-solitonic configurations of scalar fields and many plausible inflationary scenarios predict an oscillon-dominated phase in the early universe. Many possible aspects of this phase remain unexplored, particularly oscillon-oscillon interactions and interactions between oscillons and their environment. However the primary long range forces between oscillons are gravitational and thus slow-acting relative to the intrinsic timescales of the oscillons themselves. Given that simulations with local gravity are computationally expensive we explore these effects by extracting individual specimens from simulations and then engineering interactions. We find that oscillons experience friction when moving in an inhomogeneous background and, because oscillons in non-relativistic collisions bounce or merge as a function of their relative phases, the outcomes of interactions between ``wild&#39;&#39; oscillons depend on their specific trajectories.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously. From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present three rare and striking extragalactic radio sources discovered through visual inspection of low-frequency continuum maps from LoTSS DR2 and TGSS by the RAD@home citizen-science collaboratory. The first, RAD J131346.9+500320, is the first clear Odd Radio Circle (ORC) identified in LoTSS. At photometric $z \sim$ 0.94, it hosts a pair of intersecting rings of ~300 kpc diameter, embedded in diffuse emission extending over ~800 kpc, making it both the most distant and most powerful ORC reported to date. Its steep spectrum $\alpha_{54}^{144}=1.22\pm0.15$) points to a relic synchrotron origin. The second object, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a ~865 kpc giant radio galaxy whose southern jet is abruptly deflected, inflating a ~100 kpc limb-brightened ring, while the northern jet terminates in a compact hotspot-like feature. The third, RAD J142004.0+621715 (~440 kpc), shows a comparable ring at the end of its northern filamentary jet, along with a secondary filament parallel to its southern jet. All three systems lie in $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ clusters or group-scale haloes, suggesting that environmental density gradients and possible jet-galaxy interactions play a central role in shaping these ring morphologies. These discoveries expand the zoo of extragalactic radio morphologies, highlight the diversity of pathways that can generate ring-like synchrotron structures, and demonstrate the continuing importance of human pattern recognition in identifying rare sources that escape current automated pipelines.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">If the dark matter mass $m$ exceed the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} &lt; m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets - a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging, balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the $Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations - converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that were originally classified as sources with little to no radio emission. Although the class is rather unified from an optical perspective, their radio characteristics are diverse. One of the biggest curiosities found in these sources is their ability to form and maintain powerful relativistic jets. We studied the radio properties of a sample of 3998 NLS1 galaxies which is the largest clean sample available, thus allowing us to study the population-wide characteristics. We used both historical and ongoing surveys: the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS; 144~MHz), the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST; 1.4~GHz), the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS; 1.4~GHz), and the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; 3~GHz). We were able to obtain a radio detection for $\sim40\%$ of our sources, with the most detections by LoTSS. The majority of the detected NLS1 galaxies are faint ($\sim1-2$ mJy) and non-variable, suggesting considerable contributions from star formation activities, especially at 144~MHz. However, we identified samples of extreme sources, for example, in fractional variability and radio luminosity, indicating significant AGN activity. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the NLS1 galaxy population in radio and lays the foundation for targeted future studies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The appearance of highly anisotropic planes of satellites around the Milky Way and other galaxies was long considered a challenge to the standard cosmological model. Recent simulations have shown such planes to be common, but they have been described as either &#34;transient&#34;, short-lived alignments, or &#34;persistent&#34;, long-lived structures. Here we analyse Milky Way analogue systems in the cosmological simulation TNG-50 to resolve this apparent contradiction. We show that, as the satellite populations of individual hosts rapidly change, the observed anisotropies of their satellite systems are invariably short-lived, with lifetimes of no more than a few hundred million years. However, when the progenitors of the same satellites are traced backwards, we find examples where those identified to form a plane at the present day have retained spatial coherence over several Gyr. The two ostensibly conflicting predictions for the lifetimes of satellite planes can be reconciled as two perspectives on the same phenomenon.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some systems.Importantly, systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We consider the background cosmological solutions in the $6D$ (six-dimensional) model with one time and five space coordinates. The theory of our interest has the action composed by the Einstein term, cosmological constant, and two conformal terms constructed from the third powers of the Weyl tensor. It is shown how the highest derivative terms in the equations of motion can be isolated that opens the way for their numerical integration. There are flat anisotropic solutions which make one of the flat isotropic subspaces to be static. Depending on the value of bare cosmological constant, either two-dimensional or three-dimensional subspace can be static. In particular, there is a physically favorable solution with three ``large&#39;&#39; space coordinates and two extra inner dimensions stabilized. This solution is stable for a wide range of coupling constants, but this requires a special value of the bare cosmological constant.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The dissipation phenomena of relative entropy from an It\^o--Langevin dynamical system is a classic topic from stochastic analysis. Relying on the time-reversal of diffusions, a novel trajectorial approach investigates the pathwise behavior of relevant entropy processes, reveals more information from the delicate random structure, and eventually retrieves the known classical results. In essence, this approach provides novel insights and rederives the known results of the It\^o--Langevin dynamics, as will be presented in this expository article. Another part is to view the stochastic time-evolution through the lens of the Wasserstein space, under which we observe the geometric feature of steepest descent of the entropy decay as well as its exponential rate of velocity.</div>

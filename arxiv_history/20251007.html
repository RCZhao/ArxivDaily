                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The 4MOST Cosmology Redshift Survey (CRS) will obtain nearly 5.4 million spectroscopic redshifts over $\sim5700$\,deg$^2$ to map large-scale structure and enable measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), growth rates via redshift-space distortions, and cross-correlations with weak-lensing surveys. We validate the target selections, photometry, masking, systematics and redshift distributions of the CRS Bright Galaxy (BG) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target catalogues selected from DESI Legacy Surveys DR10.1 imaging. We measure the angular two-point correlation function, test masking strategies, and recover redshift distributions via cross-correlation with DESI DR1 spectroscopy. For BG, we adopt Legacy Survey \texttt{MASKBITS} that veto bright stars, SGA large galaxies, and globular clusters; for LRG, we pair these with an unWISE W1 artefact mask. These choices suppress small-scale excess power without imprinting large-scale modes. A Limber-scaling test across BG $r$-band magnitude slices shows that, after applying the scaling, the $w(\theta)$ curves collapse to a near-common power law over the fitted angular range, demonstrating photometric uniformity with depth and consistency between the North (NGC) and South (SGC) Galactic Caps. Cross-correlations with DESI spectroscopy recover the expected $N(z)$, with higher shot noise at the brightest magnitudes. For LRGs, angular clustering in photo-$z$ slices ($0.4\le z&lt;1.0$) is mutually consistent between the DECaLS and DES footprints at fixed $z$ and is well described by an approximate power law once photo-$z$ smearing is accounted for; halo-occupation fits yield results consistent with recent LRG studies. Together, these tests indicate that the masks and target selections yield uniform clustering statistics, supporting precision large-scale structure analyses with 4MOST CRS.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">It is often understood that supernova (SN) feedback in galaxies is responsible for regulating star formation and generating gaseous outflows. However, a detailed look at their effect on the local interstellar medium (ISM) on small mass scales in simulations shows that these processes proceed in clearly distinct channels. We demonstrate this finding in two independent simulations with solar-mass resolution, LYRA and RIGEL, of an isolated dwarf galaxy. Focusing on the immediate environment surrounding SNe, our findings suggest that the large-scale effect of a given SN on the galaxy is best predicted by its immediate local density. Outflows are driven by SNe in diffuse regions expanding to their cooling radii on large ($\sim$ kpc) scales, while dense star-forming regions are disrupted in a localized (\sim pc) manner. However, these separate feedback channels are only distinguishable at very high numerical resolutions capable of following scales $\ll 10^3 M_\odot$. On larger scales, ISM densities are greatly mis-estimated, and differences between local environments of SNe become severely washed out. We demonstrate the practical implications of this effect by comparing with a mid-resolution simulation ($M_{\rm ptcl.} \sim 200 M_\odot$) of the same dwarf using the SMUGGLE model. The coarse-resolution simulation cannot self-consistently determine whether a given SN is responsible for generating outflows or suppressing star formation, suggesting that emergent galaxy physics such as star formation regulation through hot-phase outflows is fundamentally unresolvable by subgrid stellar feedback models, without appealing directly to simulations with highly resolved ISM.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies are a powerful probe of small-scale mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars, we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region. Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic bar&#39;s complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar&#39;s complex morphology can lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Weakly-modelled searches for gravitational waves are essential for ensuring that all potential sources are accounted for in detection efforts, as they make minimal assumptions regarding source morphology. While these searches primarily target generic transient sources, they are also highly effective at identifying a broad range of compact binary coalescences, demonstrated by the weakly-modelled search algorithm coherent WaveBurst being the first to detect GW150914. Despite their ability to detect compact binaries with diverse properties, the accurate estimation of source parameters from their output remains to be a challenging task. To overcome this, we leverage physics-informed neural networks, which serve as a powerful tool for parameter estimation by applying physical constraints through the universal differential equation governing a compact binary system. With this approach, we rapidly infer the mass parameters of binary black hole merger systems to within 7% from only the time-frequency representation of the gravitational wave signal.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Deep neural networks excel in high-dimensional problems, outperforming models such as kernel methods, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, the theoretical foundations of this success remain poorly understood. We follow the idea that the compositional structure of the learning task is the key factor determining when deep networks outperform other approaches. Taking a step towards formalizing this idea, we consider a simple compositional model, namely the multi-index model (MIM). In this context, we introduce and study hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and kernel methods. Our main contribution is a sample complexity result demonstrating that HKRR can adaptively learn MIM, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Further, we exploit the kernel nature of the estimator to develop ad hoc optimization approaches. Indeed, we contrast alternating minimization and alternating gradient methods both theoretically and numerically. These numerical results complement and reinforce our theoretical findings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Without making any assumption on the underlying geometry and metric of the local Universe, we provide a measurement of the expansion rate fluctuation field using the Cosmicflows-4 and Pantheon+ samples in the redshift range $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ ($30 \,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc} &lt; R &lt; 300\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$). The amplitude of the anisotropic fluctuations is found to be of order a few percent relative to the monopole of the expansion rate. We further decompose the expansion rate fluctuation field into spherical harmonic components and analyze their evolution with redshift across the studied redshift range. At low redshift, the dipole is clearly dominant, with an amplitude of $\sim (2.2 \pm 0.15)\times 10^{-2}$, significantly larger than the higher--order modes. As redshift increases, the dipole amplitude steadily decreases, reaching roughly half its value in the highest redshift bin investigated. The quadrupole is also significant, at about half the dipole amplitude, and persists across all redshift bins, with no clear decreasing trend, although uncertainties grow at higher redshift. A nonzero octupole is also detected at low redshift. The dipole, quadrupole, and octupole components are found to be aligned, exhibiting axial symmetry around a common axis ($l = 295^\circ,\, b = 5^\circ$). We interpret the observed fluctuations in the expansion rate within the framework of covariant cosmography. Our results indicate that the multipoles of the expansion rate fluctuation field are primarily driven by a strong quadrupole in the covariant Hubble parameter, together with dipole and octupole contributions from the covariant deceleration parameter. These few parameters suffice to reconstruct the luminosity distance with high precision out to $z \sim 0.1$, in a manner that is model--independent, non--perturbative, and free from assumptions about peculiar velocities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model&#39;s potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent observations of compact binary systems have provided evidence for black holes with masses below standard expectations. When paired with neutron stars (NSs), such low-mass black holes (BHs) have the potential to be detected by future multimessenger campaigns and could unveil unknown features of the BH population in the universe. Given the importance of accurate models for matched-filtering searches and Bayesian parameter estimation in discoveries of this sort, attention has renewed on the limitations of low-mass NSBH merger models and on the downstream impact of such limitations on gravitational-wave data analysis. Previous numerical relativity (NR) studies have revealed discrepancies in the predicted merger time, as well as more general mismatches and dephasing between phenomenological models and high-resolution simulations. The simulation presented here was motivated by these findings and illustrates how publicly available tools can be applied to this specific science case, towards informing next-generation, more refined gravitational-wave and kilonovae models. Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed entirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature equation of state. The results we show include the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and 2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger disk formation. The system evolved for $\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of the Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\times10^{-7}$ throughout the inspiral prior to growing near merger time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Progress in modern physics has been supported by a steadily expanding corpus of numerical analyses and computational frameworks, which in turn form the basis for precision calculations and baseline predictions in experimental programs. These tools play a central role in navigating a complex landscape of theoretical models and current and potential observables to identify and understand fundamental interactions in physics. In addition, efforts to search for new fundamental interactions increasingly have a cross-disciplinary nature, such that understanding and leveraging interoperabilities among computational tools may be a significant enhancement. This work presents a new agentic AI framework, which we call ArgoLOOM, designed to bridge methodologies and computational analyses across cosmology, collider physics, and nuclear science. We describe the system contours, key internal aspects, and outline its potential for unifying scientific discovery pipelines. In the process, we demonstrate the use of ArgoLOOM on two small-scale problems to illustrate its conceptual foundations and potential for extensibility into a steadily growing agentic framework for fundamental physics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This thesis investigates the characteristics of modified teleparallel gravity models that incorporate a scalar field and a trace of the energy-momentum tensor, with particular attention to their cosmological effects, especially regarding late-time cosmic acceleration. Teleparallel gravity, as an alternative framework to General Relativity, defines gravity through torsion rather than curvature, and when combined with a scalar field, it allows exploration of a wider variety of cosmological scenarios. This thesis examines the late-time acceleration of the Universe and its various phases through dynamical system analysis within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity theories. It presents the mathematical formulations of $f(T)$, $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, $f(T, \phi)$, Horndeski teleparallel gravity, and the quintessence dark energy model, along with the application of dynamical systems and relevant cosmological datasets. Overall, the results demonstrate that these modified teleparallel gravity models provide viable descriptions of the late-time cosmic acceleration and offer insights into the dynamics of the Universe beyond standard cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Many of the tensions in cosmological models of the Universe lie in the low mass, low velocity regime. Probing this regime requires a statistically significant sample of galaxies with well measured kinematics and robustly measured uncertainties. WALLABY, as a wide area, untargetted HI survey is well positioned to construct this sample. As a first step towards this goal we develop a framework for testing kinematic modelling codes in the low resolution, low $S/N$, low rotation velocity regime. We find that the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP) is remarkably successful at modelling these galaxies when compared to other algorithms, but, even in idealized tests, there are a significant fraction of false positives found below inclinations of $\approx 40^{\circ}$. We further examine the 11 detections with rotation velocities below $50~\kms$ in the WALLABY pilot data releases. We find that those galaxies with inclinations above $40^{\circ}$ lie within $1-2~\sigma$ of structural scaling relations that require reliable rotation velocity measurements, such as the baryonic Tully Fisher relation. Moreover, the subset that have consistent kinematic and photometric inclinations tend to lie nearer to the relations than those that have inconsistent inclination measures. This work both demonstrates the challenges faced in low-velocity kinematic modelling, and provides a framework for testing modelling codes as well as constructing a large sample of well measured low rotation models from untargetted surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads, termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM&#39;s performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks with widespread applications across machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions, these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response distributions at the extreme tail conditions.</div>

We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel&#39;dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new two-dimensional (2D) map of total Galactic extinction, $A_\mathrm{V}$, across the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic space for Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;13$ deg, as well as a three-dimensional (3D) map of $A_\mathrm{V}$ within 2~kpc of the Sun. These maps are based on $A_\mathrm{V}$ and distance estimates derived from a dataset, which utilizes {\it Gaia} Data Release 3 parallaxes and multi-band photometry for nearly 100 million dwarf stars. We apply our own corrections to account for significant systematics in this dataset. Our 2D map achieves an angular resolution of 6.1~arcmin, while the 3D map offers a transverse resolution of 3.56~pc -- corresponding to variable angular resolution depending on distance -- and a radial resolution of 50~pc. In constructing these maps, we pay particular attention to the solar neighborhood (within 200~pc) and to high Galactic latitudes. The 3D map predicts $A_\mathrm{V}$ from the Sun to any extended object within the Galactic dust layer with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.1$~mag. The 2D map provides $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates for the entire dust half-layer up to extragalactic distances with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.07$~mag. We provide $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates from our maps for various classes of extended celestial objects with angular size primarily in the range of 2--40~arcmin, including 19,809 galaxies and quasars, 170 Galactic globular clusters, 458 open clusters, and several hundreds molecular clouds from two lists. We also present extinction values for 8,293 Type Ia supernovae. Comparison of our extinction estimates with those from previous maps and literature sources reveals systematic differences, indicating large-scale spatial variations in the extinction law and suggesting that earlier 2D reddening maps based on infrared dust emission tend to underestimate low extinction values.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Context. A dual active galactic nucleus candidate with a separation of only 500 pc was recently found in NGC 7727. According to the hierarchical merging scenario, such objects would be expected to merge on a timescale of a few hundred Myr. However, estimating the accurate merging timescales for the two nuclei is still a complex challenge. Aims. Using our numerical N-body code, we can trace the full evolution of central black holes during all phases: dynamical friction of unbound black holes, binary black hole formation, hardening of the system due to two-body scattering, and emission of gravitational waves leading to the final merger. Methods. Our model has next components: the bulge contains two dense stellar nuclei, each of which hosts a black hole. The most massive black hole in the center of the galaxy has a mass of 1.54x10^8 Msol and the least massive black hole in the offset second stripped nucleus has a mass of 6.33x10^6 Msol. We followed the dynamical evolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii. The black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation of motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results. Initially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system spends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the orbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In the last 10 Myr, the black hole&#39;s separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking due to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation observed today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr. Conclusions. These results have implications for the statistics of strong sources of gravitational waves at low frequencies, namely, systems engaged in an advanced state of are expected to be prime sources for the LISA mission to observe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining $O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge: the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs, which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices (RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN (I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract reasoning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a comprehensive review of the emerging crystal structure determination method Parameter Space Concept (PSC), which solves and refines either partial or complete crystal structures by mapping each experimental or theoretical observation as a geometric interpretation, bypassing the conventional Fourier inversion. The PSC utilizes only a few \xray (equivalently neutron) diffraction amplitudes or intensities and turns them into piecewise analytic hyper-surfaces, called isosurfaces, embedded in a higher-dimensional orthonormal Cartesian space (Parameter Space (PS)). It reformulates the crystal determination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common intersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds of isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized ratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods in PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The elegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates, enabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by combining multiple projections. By these means, the user may explore homometric and non-homometric solutions within both centric and acentric structures with spatial resolution remarkably down to pm, even with a limited number of diffraction reflections. Having demonstrated the potential of PSC for various synthetic structures and exemplarily verified direct application to realistic crystals, the origin and development of PSC methods are coherently discussed in this review. Notably, this review emphasizes the theoretical foundations, computational strategies, and potential extensions of PSC, outlining the roadmap for future applications of PSC in the broader context of structure determination from experimental diffraction observations.</div>

Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline ``safe&#39;&#39; behavior for the model -- the model&#39;s performance given no in-context demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control (DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction, ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs. Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The equipartition model is widely used to estimate magnetic field strength from synchrotron intensity in radio galaxies, yet the validity of its underlying assumptions remains uncertain. Using an Arepo simulation which incorporates a two-moment cosmic ray (CR) transport scheme and a multiphase interstellar medium, we compare magnetic fields inferred from synthetic synchrotron emission maps with the true fields in the simulation. Starting from the derivation of the equipartition formula, we find that the deviation between the equipartition magnetic field and the true magnetic field depends only weakly on the ratio of the magnetic to the CR energy density. In practice, for both face-on and edge-on projections, the equipartition model slightly overestimates the total synchrotron-weighted magnetic field with mean offsets of 32% (0.17 dex) and 36% (0.2 dex), even though the energy equipartition does not hold locally. Beyond these average offsets, a clear trend emerges in edge-on projections that the model underestimates the field in the disk and overestimates it in the halo. Our results demonstrate that the validity of the equipartition model depends only weakly on the strict fulfillment of energy equipartition, and that the equipartition model remains a practical method for estimating magnetic field strengths in face-on projection maps based on our CR-magnetohydrodynamics simulation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The persistence of radiative signatures in giant radio galaxies remains a frontier topic of research, with contemporary telescopes revealing intricate features that require investigation. This study aims to examine the emission characteristics of simulated GRGs, and correlate them with their underlying 3D dynamical properties. Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz were computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized emissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to reflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from these RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different locations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are strongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features like wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial indicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in GRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary structures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr. High-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon distances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the interpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the lateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source&#39;s state, with a gradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage. This study highlights that applying a simple radio power-jet power relation to a statistical GRG sample is unfeasible, as it depends on growth conditions of individual GRGs. Effects such as inverse-Compton CMB cooling and matter entrainment significantly impact the long-term emission persistence of GRGs. The diminishing fractional polarization with GRG evolution reflects increasing turbulence in the cocoon.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a Majorana scotogenic-like loop framework in which neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability are intrinsically connected to the breaking of the discrete flavor symmetry $A_4$. This breaking leads to the emergence of the scoto-seesaw mechanism and a $Z_2$ symmetry. This naturally explains the solar and atmospheric mass-squared differences, $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$, while simultaneously ensuring dark matter stability. Our model accommodates normal ordering of neutrino masses, with a generalized $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry shaping the structure of leptonic mixing and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Moreover, the model provides predictions for the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and a strong correlation between $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$. This correlation puts a lower bound on the fermionic DM mass. In contrast, scalar dark matter remains viable over a broad mass spectrum. A notable feature is that the low mass regime ($\sim 15$ GeV onwards) survives owing to the presence of efficient co-annihilation channels, which are typically absent in the Majorana scotogenic scenario. Additionally, the model aligns with current and future limits from lepton flavor violation experiments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source&#39;s distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.</div>

This paper introduces AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In 2023, KM3NeT observed the highest energy neutrino seen to date. The most probable estimate places the energy of the neutrino at an extreme value of 220 PeV, and energies up to 2.6 EeV are contained in the $90\%$ probability interval. Even though the source of the signal cannot be ascertained with the available data, this observation already opens unique possibilities to test new physics. Here, we study the implications for the transition magnetic dipole portal connecting active and sterile neutrinos. We remain agnostic regarding the origin of the neutrino and focus on local effects. Concretely, we study the contribution of an efficient active to sterile transitions to the opacity seen on the path to the detector at Earth. We find that the ultra-high-energy neutrino event does not add relevant information for sterile neutrinos with masses less than a TeV. However, the observation becomes important at higher masses and can provide the leading constraint in that regime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Self-lensing (SL) represents a powerful technique for detecting compact objects in binary systems through gravitational microlensing effects, when a compact companion transits in front of its luminous partner. We present the first comprehensive study of SL probability within globular cluster (GC) environments, utilizing synthetic stellar populations from MOCCA simulations to predict detection rates for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Our analysis incorporates finite-size lens effects for white dwarf (WD) lenses and the specific observational characteristics of the ELT/MICADO instrument. We find that present-day GCs contain 1-50 SL sources with magnifications $\mu_\mathrm{sl} &gt; 1+10^{-8}$, strongly dependent on initial binary fraction, with systems dominated by WD lenses paired with low-mass main-sequence companions. The predicted populations exhibit characteristic bimodal magnitude distributions with peaks at $m \approx 24$ and 32 mag at 10 kpc distance, and typical Einstein ring crossing times of $\tau_\mathrm{eff} \sim 2$ hours. ELT observations should achieve detection efficiency of 0.015-10 sources in $\sim150$ nearby GC after a year of observations depending on distance and survey strategy, with nearby clusters ($D \lesssim 10$ kpc) offering the highest yields. Multi-year monitoring campaigns with daily cadence provide order-of-magnitude improvements over single observations through enhanced photometric precision and increased detection probability. Our results demonstrate that coordinated ELT surveys of Galactic GCs represent a viable approach for probing hidden binary populations and compact object demographics in dense stellar environments, with comprehensive programs potentially yielding up to 10-100 well-characterized SL sources after first 5 years of observations suitable for statistical studies of binary evolution in extreme environments.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs are being measured with higher precision as the Run 3 stage of LHC continues. Models with multiple Higgs doublets allow potential deviations from the SM predictions. For more than two doublets, there are five possible types of models that avoid flavor changing neutral couplings at tree level by the addition of a symmetry. We consider a softly broken Z2xZ2 three-Higgs doublet model with explicit CP violation in the scalar sector, exploring all five possible types of coupling choices and all five mass orderings of the neutral scalar bosons. The phenomenological study is performed using a Machine Learning black box optimization algorithm that efficiently searches for the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings. We identify the model choices that allow a purely pseudoscalar coupling in light of all recent experimental limits, including direct searches for CP-violation, thus motivating increased effort into improving the experimental precision.</div>

This addresses a significant open challenge for GVI and Federated GVI that employ a different divergence to the Kullback--Leibler under prior misspecification, operate within a subset of possible probability measures, and result in intractable posteriors. Our theoretical contributions cover severe prior misspecification while relying on our ability to restrict the space of possible GVI posterior measures, and infer properties based on this space. In particular, we are able to establish sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of GVI posteriors on arbitrary Polish spaces, prove that the GVI posterior measure concentrates on a neighbourhood of loss minimisers, and extend this to rates of convergence regardless of the prior measure.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">For a square matrix, the range of its Rayleigh quotients is known as the numerical range, which is a compact and convex set by the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem. The largest value and the smallest boundary value (in magnitude) of this convex set are known as the numerical radius and inner numerical radius respectively. The numerical radius is often used to study the convergence rate of iterative methods for solving linear systems. In this work, we investigate these radii for complex non-Hermitian random matrix and its elliptic variants. For the former, remarkably, these radii can be represented as extrema of a stationary Airy-like process, which undergoes a correlation-decorrelation transition from small to large time scale. Based on this transition, we obtain the precise first and second order terms of the numerical radii. In the elliptic case, we prove that the fluctuation of the numerical radii boils down to the maximum or minimum of two independent Tracy-Widom variables.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We explore the restoration of chiral symmetry in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks under the influence of strong magnetic fields and finite temperature, incorporating screening effects through ring diagrams. While previous studies using tree-level thermal masses lead to magnetic catalysis across all temperature ranges, in tension with lattice QCD results, we go beyond this limitation by computing the bosonic masses self-consistently within the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The self-consistent approach modifies the effective potential and allows us to accurately track the thermal evolution of the order parameter. Our results reveal the emergence of a critical end point (CEP) in the $T-|eB|$ phase diagram and, notably, exhibit inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) behavior: the (pseudo)critical temperature decreases with increasing magnetic field strength. This is in contrast to the magnetic catalysis behavior found when non-self-consistent masses are used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that self-consistent boson masses have been implemented in this context, offering a new framework for exploring the QCD phase diagram using effective models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy&#39;s assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy&#39;s earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.30. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.62) with a tilt angle of $12.22^{\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context? To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts: scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance, showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores, disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e. co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T&gt;0.5$, $N_{\rm star}&gt;10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity $\epsilon &lt; -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%), in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD&#39;s star population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow, suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy&#39;s past accretion history.</div>

In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \times 10^{12} $ M$_\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z &lt; 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Within the framework of scalar-non-metricity gravity, we introduce a steep potential together with a power-law coupling function and investigate whether the acceleration phases of the universe can be consistently described by this model. In the symmetric teleparallel formulation, and under a Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker background, three distinct branches of the connection arise, leading to three different cosmological scenarios. We perform a detailed dynamical analysis of these models by examining the phase space and determining the asymptotic cosmological solutions. The analysis reveals a rich hierarchy of critical points, including matter-dominated epochs, kinetic-dominated stiff-fluid regimes, and steep potential-dominated de Sitter solutions, along with asymptotic trajectories that approach Big Crunch or Big Rip singularities, as well as transient, unstable matter-dominated eras. The stability of the steep potential-dominated de Sitter points is further studied using Center Manifold Theory, showing that, under specific parametric conditions, the model can provide a unified description of both the early and late-time acceleration phases of the universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Optimal transport has emerged as a fundamental methodology with applications spanning multiple research areas in recent years. However, the convergence rate of the empirical estimator to its population counterpart suffers from the curse of dimensionality, which prevents its application in high-dimensional spaces. While entropic regularization has been proven to effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality and achieve a parametric convergence rate under mild conditions, these statistical guarantees have not been extended to general regularizers. Our work bridges this gap by establishing analogous results for a broader family of regularizers. Specifically, under boundedness constraints, we prove a convergence rate of order $n^{-1/2} with respect to sample size n. Furthermore, we derive several central limit theorems for divergence regularized optimal transport.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Chaos expansions are widely used in global sensitivity analysis (GSA), as they leverage orthogonal bases of L2 spaces to efficiently compute Sobol&#39; indices, particularly in data-scarce settings. When derivatives are available, we argue that a desirable property is for the derivatives of the basis functions to also form an orthogonal basis. We demonstrate that the only basis satisfying this property is the one associated with weighted Poincar{\&#39;e} inequalities and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems, which we refer to as the Poincar{\&#39;e} basis. We then introduce a comprehensive framework for gradient-enhanced GSA that integrates recent advances in sparse, gradient-enhanced regression for surrogate modeling with the construction of weighting schemes for derivative-based sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology is applicable to a broad class of probability measures and supports various choices of weights. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on a challenging flood modeling case study, where Sobol&#39; indices are accurately estimated using limited data.</div>

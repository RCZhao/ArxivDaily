                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The effective redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2pt) to constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 Maglim catalog and the Planck satellite PR4 data release. We include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to 2.$^\prime$5 and model baryonic feedback processes via principal components (PCs) that are constructed from the ANTILLES simulations. We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of the first PC $Q_1$ and mean normalized baryon mass fraction $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}=\bar{f}_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/\Omega_\mathrm{m})$ from the ANTILLES simulations and employ an independent $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of $Q_1$. We train a neural network $6\times2$pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, which enables us to run an impressive number of simulated analyses to validate our analysis against various systematics. For our 6$\times$2pt analysis, we find $S_8=0.8073\pm0.0094$ when including a $Q_1$ prior from $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ observations. This level of cosmological constraining power allows us to put tight constraints on the strength of baryonic feedback. We find $Q_1=0.025^{+0.024}_{-0.029}$ for our 6$\times$2pt analysis and $Q_1=0.043\pm{0.016}$ when combining with external information from Planck, ACT, DESI. All these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the tensions to Illustris ($Q_1=0.095$) and OWLS AGN T8.7 ($Q_1=0.137$) are 2.9$\sigma$-3.3$\sigma$ and 4.7$\sigma$-5.9$\sigma$, respectively.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. While our results are consistent within $\lesssim 2\sigma$ with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, they exhibit stronger tension with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior, highlighting the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</div>

The model embeds cosmology-dependent optical selection using a counts-in-cylinders approach, while also accounting for cluster miscentering and baryonic feedback in lensing. Applied to DES-Y1, and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we obtain $\Omega_m=0.254^{+0.026}_{-0.020}$ and $\sigma_8=0.826^{+0.030}_{-0.034}$, consistent with a broad suite of low-redshift structure measurements, including recent full-shape analyses, the DES/KiDS/HSC 3$\times$2 results, and most cluster-abundance studies. Our results are also consistent with \textit{Planck}, with the difference being significant at $2.58\sigma$. These results establish simulation-based forward-modeling of cluster abundances as a promising new tool for precision cosmology with Stage~IV survey data.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Pretrained Transformers demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified architectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), data models (e.g., linear regression with isotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to realistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with nonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with heterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where the MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single gradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional asymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to structured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of Gaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that nonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear tasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data mixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low noise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when the task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated empirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data distributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving multilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different source. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings extend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical foundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the role of architecture and data in ICL.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</div>

(2) is there a generic &#39;missing dwarfs&#39; problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here enables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~ 10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for the galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move closer to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the knee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result in a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies. While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model provides a fully analytical and physically motivated description of the merger-ringdown gravitational radiation emanating from a black hole binary merger. We perform a comprehensive validation of BOB for the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of quasi-circular and non-precessing systems, assessing its accuracy against numerical relativity (NR) simulations, state-of-the-art waveform models, and a sum of quasinormal modes. We demonstrate that BOB most accurately describes the gravitational wave news, achieving accuracy comparable to highly-calibrated Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate models. Because BOB is minimally tuned to NR catalogs, it retains a high level of accuracy in regions of the parameter space sparsely covered by current NR catalogs. BOB yields an analytic link between the amplitude of the fundamental quasinormal mode and the peak amplitude of the News, which we verify to within the errors of a surrogate ringdown model. We identify a flavor of BOB that requires only the remnant mass and spin, yet matches the accuracy of models that fit a sum of many overtones. Lastly, we show that BOB accurately models both the mass and current quadrupole waves for superkick configurations, contrary to a claim in the literature, and explain why that study was not actually implementing BOB as it has been defined. Our findings establish BOB as a powerful tool for gravitational wave analysis, for providing independent tests of NR-calibrated models, and for better understanding the underlying physics of the merger. We provide a companion python package, gwBOB, allowing for the easy construction of various flavors of BOB and comparison to NR waveforms.</div>

Our novel strategy merges two complementary approaches: (i) a dispersive solver based on Lehmann representations and subtracted dispersion relations, and (ii) a M--PINN that learns the fermion mass function $B(p^2)$, under the same truncation and renormalization configuration (quenched, rainbow, Landau gauge) with the loss integrating the DSE residual with multi--scale regularization, and monotonicity/smoothing penalties in the spacelike branch in the same way as in our previous work in Euclidean space. The benchmarks show quantitative agreement from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) scales in both on-shell and momentum-subtraction schemes. In this controlled setting, our M--PINN reproduces the dispersive solution whilst remaining computationally compact and differentiable, paving the way for extensions with realistic vertices, unquenching effects, and uncertainty-aware variants.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group&#39;s dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group&#39;s barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN) theory compare with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole (BBH) systems. In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although these definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ by finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each companion&#39;s inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory -- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that preserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the apparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the leading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle) parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon penetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the PN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework provides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be extended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges.</div>

Traditional approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a general strategy for turning generative models into candidate solution samplers for batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The use of generative models for BO enables large batch scaling as generative sampling, optimization of non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional and combinatorial design. Inspired by the success of direct preference optimization (DPO), we show that one can train a generative model with noisy, simple utility values directly computed from observations to then form proposal distributions whose densities are proportional to the expected utility, i.e., BO&#39;s acquisition function values. Furthermore, this approach is generalizable beyond preference-based feedback to general types of reward signals and loss functions. This perspective avoids the construction of surrogate (regression or classification) models, common in previous methods that have used generative models for black-box optimization. Theoretically, we show that the generative models within the BO process approximately follow a sequence of distributions which asymptotically concentrate at the global optima under certain conditions. We also demonstrate this effect through experiments on challenging optimization problems involving large batches in high dimensions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) holds crucial clues to their origins. For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework to assess the detectability and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors, while accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers eccentric SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution, dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect the SGWBs from both isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and 170. However, these backgrounds are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly eccentric SBBHs formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and sharp decline. While this feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a clear distinction from the strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we utilize the ray-tracing method to conduct an in-depth study of the observational images of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the Kalb-Ramond field. Initially, we calculate the null geodesics and effective potential energy of ATSW, and investigate the variations in the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter l. Based on these calculations, we determine the photon deflection angles and trajectories within this space-time structure. Specifically, depending on the photon impact parameters, the photon trajectories can be categorized into three types. By using a thin accretion disk as the sole background light source and incorporating two classical observational radiation models, we find that under conditions of equal mass M, charge quantity Q, and Lorentz-violation parameter l, the asymmetric thin-shell wormhole exhibits unique observational features such as additional lensing rings and photon ring clusters. Furthermore, distinct from black holes, as the charge quantity Q and the Lorentz-violation parameter l increase, the coverage area of the specific additional halo also expands correspondingly.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We show that the merger of oscillons results in a broad spectrum of the oscillon mass. A huge number of oscillon samples obtained from numerical lattice simulations reveal that the oscillon mass distribution has an exponential tail in a heavy-mass region. This enables us to infer the fractional abundance of heavy oscillons. Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons. It can be an alternative PBH formation mechanism without employing the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance the small-scale density fluctuations in the conventional PBH formation scenario.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query&#39;s `Reasoning Tree&#39;. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and dynamically modifying the model&#39;s policy at each node. When combined with data scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy. However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score (r-score), which measures the query&#39;s learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.</div>

Dark matter direct detection experiments look for nuclear recoil signals from DM-nucleus elastic scattering, which can be used to characterise DM.

In this work, we investigate the impact of nuclear shell model interactions on DM nuclear responses for silicon and germanium targets using a SuperCDMS-like experimental parameters.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide constraints for future space-based detectors.</div>

Focusing on a dimension-six, lepton number conserving operator, we explore how new interactions can significantly alter the production and equilibration dynamics of right-handed neutrinos. We derive the relevant quantum kinetic equations incorporating both renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions and perform a comprehensive numerical analysis for benchmark scenarios in both the oscillatory and overdamped regimes. Our results reveal that even in the absence of explicit lepton number violation by the operator, it can enhance or suppress the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) by several orders of magnitude, depending on the EFT scale. We further connect these effects to predictions for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, demonstrating that the same operator can lead to enhanced decay rates, potentially within reach of the next generation of experiments. Our findings indicate that the observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ could rule out a large part of the parameter space for successful low-scale LG within the $\nu$SMEFT, implying low RHN masses and low reheating temperatures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting effective risk control.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation&#39;s origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM&#39;s current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We compute asymptotic Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies -- i.e. frequencies with a very large Imaginary part -- of a Loop Quantum Gravity inspired Black Hole. The deformations from the Schwarzschild Black Hole are encoded via two parameters: the minimal area gap $a_0$ and the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. In this study, we focus on the effect of the latter one, $P$, on the highly-damped part of QNM spectra. We consider both spin 0 and spin 2 test-field perturbations on the Black Hole as proper gravitational perturbations cannot be performed on an effective model. We use an analytical method of computation of QNMs referred to as the monodromy technique, which allows us to compute the asymptotic behaviour of QNMs. We found interesting oscillating behaviour in both the Real part and the Imaginary part of the QNMs, where the oscillation period varies with the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. We compare these analytical predictions to numerical results obtained thanks to the Continued fraction method. Even though the latter does not converge for QNMs with a very large Imaginary part, the numerical results are in rather good agreement with the monodromy prediction.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Tree ensembles have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictive performance across a wide range of problems involving tabular data. Nevertheless, the black-box nature of tree ensembles is a strong limitation, especially for applications with critical decisions at stake. The Hoeffding or ANOVA functional decomposition is a powerful explainability method, as it breaks down black-box models into a unique sum of lower-dimensional functions, provided that input variables are independent. In standard learning settings, input variables are often dependent, and the Hoeffding decomposition is generalized through hierarchical orthogonality constraints. Such generalization leads to unique and sparse decompositions with well-defined main effects and interactions. However, the practical estimation of this decomposition from a data sample is still an open problem. Therefore, we introduce the TreeHFD algorithm to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of a tree ensemble from a data sample. We show the convergence of TreeHFD, along with the main properties of orthogonality, sparsity, and causal variable selection. The high performance of TreeHFD is demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real data, using our treehfd Python package (https://github.com/ThalesGroup/treehfd). Besides, we empirically show that the widely used TreeSHAP method, based on Shapley values, is strongly connected to the Hoeffding decomposition.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the cross-correlation between astrometric and timing-residual observables for distant sources, such as pulsars and galaxies, and equivalent observables for nearby solar system bodies. Using the unified spin-weighted formalism introduced in [1], we derive the angular correlation functions-generalised Hellings-Downs curves-that describe the response of these mixed observables to a stochastic, unpolarised gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity for such measurements, focusing on cross-correlations between pulsar timing array (PTA) redshift signals and astrometric or distortion (shimmering) effects induced in solar system objects such as asteroids. Although the current astrometric precision of asteroid tracking does not yet provide competitive constraints relative to PTA-only surveys, the method offers a complementary probe with enhanced sensitivity at higher frequencies. Future wide-field surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB. A key advantage of the technique is its reduced susceptibility to correlated systematics across different measurement domains, providing an independent cross-check of PTA detections and a potential observational bridge between PTA and LISA frequency bands.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state&#39;s potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Thanks to new advances in astronomical imaging, we can now routinely explore disk galaxy profiles about two magnitudes deeper than the data available 20 years ago. In this regard, it is an opportune time to reevaluate the past classifications of different surface brightness Types. In this paper, we explore the stellar mass profiles of a sample of disk galaxies with similar stellar masses ($\sim$10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) using IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project data. We find that Type I, II-CT, and III-d galaxies exhibit edges at surface brightnesses $\mu_g$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$26.5 mag/arcsec$^2$ and surface mass densities $\Sigma$(R$_{edge}$)$\sim$0.5-1 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. These surface brightnesses were outside the range of typical SDSS images and, therefore, unstudied. The present data suggest (although the statistics are inconclusive) that the main difference between the previous profile Types is the presence of either a more or a less intense bulge. Half of the Type II-CT galaxies are Sc, whereas half of the Type III-d galaxies are Sb. Finally, Type III-d galaxies have low mass surface density disks ($\Sigma$($\Delta$ $R_{\mathrm{exp}}$)$\sim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$) and are bluer $(g-r)_0$=0.32$\pm$0.02 than the other Types ($(g-r)_0$=0.42$\pm$0.02 for Type I and II-CT), suggesting that their disks probably formed later in time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We have performed the dynamical system analysis to obtain the critical point in which, the value of the geometric and dynamical parameters satisfy the late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe. At the outset, the modified Friedmann equations have been reformulated into a system of coupled differential equations to ensure that the minimal set of equations required for a second-order $f(Q)$ gravity. Then these equations are solved numerically to constrain the parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and high-precision Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia Supernovae datasets are used to constrain the parameters. The evolution of key cosmological parameters indicates that the model exhibits quintessence-like behavior at present, with a tendency to converge towards the $\Lambda$CDM model at late-times. The dynamic system analysis provided the critical points that correspond to different phases of the Universe, which are analyzed in detail. The existence of a stable de Sitter attractor confirms the accelerating behavior of the model.</div>

We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures how closely a policy model&#39;s reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training. These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model&#39;s reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains. Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The LHC generates an intense beam of high-energy neutrinos in the forward direction, whose scientific potential has been left unexploited for many years. The FASER and SND@LHC experiments, operating since 2023, have recently measured LHC neutrinos for the first time. In this contribution we discuss how to produce accurate predictions, including NLO QCD corrections and modern parton shower algorithms, for present and future LHC neutrino experiments, including those at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). To this end, the energy and rapidity distribution of the LHC neutrinos is encoded in a LHAPDF grid interfaced to the neutrino DIS event generator in the POWHEG-BOX-RES framework. This Monte Carlo tool enables the modelling of differential distributions that are sensitive to hadronic final states, initial- and final-state radiation, and realistic acceptance and selection cuts. As a first application, we deploy this event generator to compute fast-interpolation grids and carry out a first determination of the LHC forward neutrino fluxes directly from FASER data using the NNPDF fitting methodology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The strong coupling $\alpha_s$ is determined with high precision from fits to lattice QCD simulations on the static energy. Our theoretical setup relies on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy by removing its $u=1/2$ renormalon and summing up the associated large (infrared) logarithms which, in combination with radius-dependent renormalization scales (called profile functions) extends the validity of perturbation theory to distances up to $\sim 0.5\,$fm. Furthermore, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization group evolution. We have checked that the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher remnants in a non-symmetric way, hence we also account for this potential bias. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is based on a random scan over the parameters specifying the profile functions and the treatment of R-evolution. We also devise a method to statistically combine into a single dataset results from independent simulations which use different lattice spacing and cover various ranges, which can be used to carry out fits in a much faster way. We explore the dependence of the extracted $\alpha_s$ value on the smallest and largest distances included in the dataset, on how R-evolution is treated, on how the fit is performed, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, after evolving to the $Z$-pole we obtain $\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1166\pm 0.0009$, compatible with the world average with similar incertitude.</div>

By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.</div>

In this setting, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based solvers have demonstrated strong empirical performance in recent machine learning applications, yet their theoretical guarantee to approximate the OT map is an open question. In this work, we answer it positively by providing both computational and statistical convergence guarantees of SGD. Specifically, we show that SGD methods can estimate the OT map with a minimax convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of samples drawn from $\mu$. To establish this result, we study the averaged projected SGD algorithm, and identify a suitable projection set that contains a minimizer of the objective, even when the source measure is not compactly supported. Our analysis holds under mild assumptions on the source measure and applies to MTW cost functions,whic include $\|\cdot\|^p$ for $p \in (1, \infty)$. We finally provide numerical evidence for our theoretical results.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present proper motion (PM) measurements for Draco II, an ultra-faint dwarf satellite of the Milky Way. These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging separated by a 7 year time baseline. Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to the low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame. We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: 1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results. We find that for this sparse, low-luminosity regime including background galaxies into the reference frame improves our measurement by up to $\sim2\times$ versus using only Gaia astrometric data. Using 301 background galaxies as a reference frame, we find that Draco II&#39;s systemic PM is $(\mu_{\alpha}^*, \mu_{\delta}) = (1.043\pm0.029, 0.879\pm0.028)$ mas/yr, which is the most precise measurement of the three we present in this paper.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the convergence of off-policy TD(0) with linear function approximation when used to approximate the expected discounted reward in a Markov chain. It is well known that the combination of off-policy learning and function approximation can lead to divergence of the algorithm. Existing results for this setting modify the algorithm, for instance by reweighing the updates using importance sampling. This establishes convergence at the expense of additional complexity. In contrast, our approach is to analyse the standard algorithm, but to restrict our attention to the class of reversible Markov chains. We demonstrate convergence under this mild reversibility condition on the structure of the chain, which in many applications can be assumed using domain knowledge. In particular, we establish a convergence guarantee under an upper bound on the discount factor in terms of the difference between the on-policy and off-policy process. This improves upon known results in the literature that state that convergence holds for a sufficiently small discount factor by establishing an explicit bound. Convergence is with probability one and achieves projected Bellman error equal to zero. To obtain these results, we adapt the stochastic approximation framework that was used by Tsitsiklis and Van Roy [1997 for the on-policy case, to the off-policy case. We illustrate our results using different types of reversible Markov chains, such as one-dimensional random walks and random walks on a weighted graph.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent work by Ringermacher and Mead has revealed discrete oscillations in the cosmological scale factor, suggesting that spacetime may exhibit vibrational properties akin to those of a crystal. Building on this idea, we propose a novel geometric interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB angular power spectrum by treating it as an inverted X-ray diffractogram of early spacetime. In this framework,the acoustic peaks correspond to constructive interference from a stratified, resonant structure of the universe at the time of recombination. We formulate a cosmological analogue of Bragg law, linking angular multipoles to acoustic shell spacing and comoving distance. This model predicts the positions of the first four acoustic peaks observed by the Planck satellite with remarkable accuracy.A global correction factor of near 0.9 needed to align predictions with observations, may reflect the influence of geometric torsion as described in EinsteinCartan theory. While not a replacement for full radiative transfer modeling,this approach offers a complementary geometric framework for understanding the harmonic structure of the CMB and the possible crystalline nature of primordial spacetime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Molecular transitions -- such as protein folding, allostery, and membrane transport -- are central to biology yet remain notoriously difficult to simulate. Their intrinsic rarity pushes them beyond reach of standard molecular dynamics, while enhanced-sampling methods are costly and often depend on arbitrary variables that bias outcomes. We introduce Gen-COMPAS, a generative committor-guided path sampling framework that reconstructs transition pathways without predefined variables and at a fraction of the cost. Gen-COMPAS couples a generative diffusion model, which produces physically realistic intermediates, with committor-based filtering to pinpoint transition states. Short unbiased simulations from these intermediates rapidly yield full transition-path ensembles that converge within nanoseconds, where conventional methods require orders of magnitude more sampling. Applied to systems from a miniprotein to a ribose-binding protein to a mitochondrial carrier, Gen-COMPAS retrieves committors, transition states, and free-energy landscapes efficiently, uniting machine learning and molecular dynamics for broad mechanistic and practical insight.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification, quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However, these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning. Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by 3.9% to 8.5%</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate cosmic birefringence through a Chern-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\alpha+\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT&#39;s high-$\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies is one of the key secondary signals to cosmic shear measurements, and must be modeled to interpret weak lensing data and infer the correct cosmology. There are large uncertainties in the physical description of IA, and analytical calculations are often out of reach for weak lensing statistics beyond two-point functions. We present here a set of six flexible IA models infused directly into weak lensing simulations, constructed from the mass shells, the projected tidal fields and, optionally, dark matter halo catalogues. We start with the non-linear linear alignment (NLA) and progressively sophisticate the galaxy bias and the tidal coupling models, including the commonly-used extended NLA (also known as the e-NLA or $\delta$-NLA) and the tidal torque (TT) models. We validate our methods with MCMC analyses from two-point shear statistics, then compute the impact on non-Gaussian cosmic shear probes from these catalogues as well as from reconstructed convergence maps. We find that the $\delta$-NLA model has by far the largest impact on most probes, at times more than twice the strength of the NLA. We also observe large differences between the IA models in under-dense regions, which makes minima, void profiles and lensing PDF the best probes for model rejection. Furthermore, our bias models allow us to separately study the source-clustering term for each of these probes, finding good agreement with the existing literature, and extending the results to these new probes. The third-order aperture mass statistics ($M^3_{ap}$) and the integrated three-point functions are particularly sensitive to this when including low-redshift data, often exceeding a 20% impact on the data vector. Our IA models are straightforward to implement and rescale from a single simulated IA-infused galaxy catalogue, allowing for fast model exploration.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the first results of V\textit{z}-GAL, a high-redshift CO(\textit{J} = 1 $-$ 0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 \textit{Herschel}-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). This flux density-limited sample includes 106 DSFGs in total, along with 14 galaxies from a recent pilot study -- altogether doubling the to-date available high-redshift \coonezero observations. These sources cover redshifts 1 to 6 with available mid/high-\textit{J} CO transitions from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array \zgal survey. We detect \coonezero emission in 90/92 targets above signal-to-noise ratio of 2, while two DSFGs remain undetected. \vzgal also covers additional \cotwoone emission lines in 10 of these sources. We find gas masses of the entire \vzgal sample to be $\rm (\alpha_{CO}/{4.0}) \mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, calibrated using \coonezero line luminosities. We confirm that these DSFGs -- with derived gas depletion timescales of $(50-600)$ Myr -- represent a heterogeneous population, potentially comprising both main-sequence galaxies and starbursts in the early Universe. Using \coonezero luminosities as an anchor, we robustly derive the CO brightness temperature ratios with a good statistical significance up to \textit{J} = 6. Our measurements reveal a broad range of gas excitation conditions across the \vzgal DSFGs. We also explore [CI](1$-$0)/CO(1$-$0) ratios in 23 \vzgal galaxies that have existing detections of atomic carbon ground-state emission, [CI](1$-$0), from the \zgal survey. Our results show similar [CI]/CO ratio values across cosmic time for starbursts and local star-forming galaxy populations, supporting the use of \cionezero as an alternative cold gas tracer.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Inferring cosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data requires repeated and computationally expensive calculations of theoretical angular power spectra using Boltzmann solvers like CAMB. This creates a significant bottleneck, particularly for non-standard cosmological models and the high-accuracy demands of future surveys. While emulators based on deep neural networks can accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude, they first require large, pre-computed training datasets, which are costly to generate and model-specific. To address this challenge, we introduce gCAMB, a version of the CAMB code ported to GPUs, which preserves all the features of the original CPU-only code. By offloading the most computationally intensive modules to the GPU, gCAMB significantly accelerates the generation of power spectra, saving massive computational time, halving the power consumption in high-accuracy settings and, among other purposes, facilitating the creation of extensive training sets needed for robust cosmological analyses. We make the gCAMB software available to the community at https://github.com/lstorchi/CAMB/tree/gpuport.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The formation of the Universe&#39;s first luminous stellar structures depends on the unique conditions at &#34;Cosmic Dawn,&#34; which are set by the underlying cosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that high-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of stellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We investigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which explore the capacity for $\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density systems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark matter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution in early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities even in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We analyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of structure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the brightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of individual $z\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\odot$ is challenging, although lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially if a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters separately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of the high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass clusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a promising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates much of the friction in the process. SymBoltz enables up to 100x shorter model definitions compared to browsing equivalent files in CLASS. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary expressions from the solution. Modern implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times, reducing slowdowns by taking long time steps, reusing the Jacobian and LU-factorizing it over several time steps, and using fast linear system solvers. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. These features are useful in their own rights, but also reinforce each other in a synergy. Results agree with established codes like CLASS and CAMB. With more work, SymBoltz can grow into an integrated symbolic-numeric cosmological modeling environment with a large library of models that delivers differentiable output as fast as other codes. SymBoltz is available at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes questions, suggestions and contributions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using ultra-deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GLIMPSE Survey, enhanced by gravitational lensing of the AbellS1063 cluster, we investigate the faintest galaxies ever observed in the redshift range z~9 to z~15. We identify 105 galaxy candidates within this range, spanning absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitudes from M_UV~-18 to M_UV~-13 mag, about three magnitudes fainter, on average, than prior JWST studies. We place strong constraints on the ultra-faint end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF), finding minimal evolution in the faint-end slope, which varies from $\alpha=-2.01\pm0.20 at z=9 to \alpha=-2.10\pm0.19$ at z=13. This behaviour contrasts with the rapid evolution of the faint-end slope observed from z~0 to z~9. By integrating the UVLF down to M_UV=-16, we derive the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)from z=9 to z=13, revealing a best-fit redshift evolution that follows $\propto(1+z)^{-2.94^{+0.06}_{-0.10}}$. This slope is significantly shallower than predictions from most theoretical models. Extending the integration limit to M_UV=-13, we find that galaxies fainter than M_UV=-16 contribute more than 50% of the total cosmic SFR density at z~12. The observed excess in the cosmic SFRD at these high redshifts may suggest an enhancement in the star formation efficiency during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. Alternatively, this could result from other physical mechanisms, such as bursty star formation histories; minimal dust attenuation; or an evolving initial mass function. However, existing models that incorporate these scenarios fail to fully reproduce the observed redshift evolution of SFRD. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of low-redshift contamination and cosmic variance, as the small survey volume may not represent the broader galaxy population. Similar observations in different fields and spectroscopic confirmation are required to validate these findings</div>

We then present a range of numerical algorithms for both wave- and fluid-based simulations, discuss their respective advantages and limitations, and highlight representative test problems. To facilitate code comparison, we also provide publicly available initial condition files for both isolated-halo and cosmological simulations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Future gravitational wave detections of merging binary neutron star systems have the possibility to tightly constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. In order to extract such constraints, gravitational waveform models need to be calibrated to accurate numerical relativity simulations of the late inspiral and merger. In this work, we take an essential step toward classifying the error and potential systematics in current generation numerical relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars. To this end, we perform a direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects, including the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved. We find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within current numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable in cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the waveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with earlier findings in the literature. We also discuss current limitations and cost estimates for numerical relativity simulations to reach the accuracies required in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Scalar-tensor gravity represents a natural extension of general relativity. Testing such models experimentally provides a crucial pathway to probing physics at high-energy scales, particularly in the context of string theory. This paper investigates a string-theory-inspired scalar-tensor gravity -- the dilaton model -- and identifies regions of its parameter space potentially constrained by gravitational redshift experiments in future. By further modeling the mass distribution in low-density environments with a discrete representation, we go beyond the standard continuous approximation. Despite limitations inherent to specific experimental configurations, our analysis reveals that a significant portion of the parameter space remains accessible. Consequently, high-precision gravitational redshift experiments hold the potential to exclude significant regions of this parameter space in future.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Mass-modeling methods are used to infer the gravitational field of stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant elliptical galaxies. While many methods exist, most require assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution function or data binning that leads to loss of information. With only line-of-sight (LOS) data, many methods suffer from the well-known mass-anisotropy degeneracy. To overcome these limitations, we develop a new, publicly available mass-modeling method, GravSphere2. This combines individual stellar velocities from LOS and proper motion (PM) measurements to solve the Jeans equations up to fourth order, without any data binning. Using flexible functional forms for the anisotropy profiles at second and fourth order, we show how including additional constraints from a new observable - fourth-order PMs - fully closes the system of equations, breaking the mass-anisotropy degeneracy at all orders. We test our method on mock data for dwarf galaxies, showing how GravSphere2 improves on previous methods. GravSphere2 recovers the mass density, stellar velocity anisotropy, and logarithmic slope of the mass density profile within its quoted 95% confidence intervals across almost all mocks over a wide radial range (0.1 &lt; R/Rhalf &lt; 10). We find GravSphere2 outperforms simple mass estimators, suggesting that it is worth using even when only a few LOS velocities are available. With 1,000 tracers without PMs, GravSphere2 recovers the logarithmic density slope at Rhalf with 12% (25%) statistical errors for cuspy (cored) mock data, enabling a distinction between the two. Including PMs, this improves to 8% (12%). With just 100 tracers and no PMs, we recover slopes with ~ 30% (20%) errors. GravSphere2 will be a valuable new tool to hunt for black holes and dark matter in spherical stellar systems, from globular clusters and dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals and galaxy clusters.</div>

Vision Transformers allows us to emulate the energy deposition from detailed Geant4 simulations. We evaluate the networks using high-level observables, neural network classifiers, and sampling timings, showing minimum deviations from Geant4 while achieving faster generation.

In addition to modifying the global 21-cm signal, these processes would leave distinct imprints on the frequency-resolved 21-cm power spectrum with a morphology jointly set by the time- and spatial-dependence of energy emission and absorption. In this work, we extend the DM21cm code package, which models the effects of spatially inhomogeneous energy emission and deposition on 21-cm cosmology, to study three well-motivated scenarios which 21-cm measurements are particularly well-suited to probe: dark matter annihilation through $p$-wave processes, the Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes, and energetic emission from accreting solar-mass primordial black holes. We project sensitivities to each of these scenarios, demonstrating that leading or near leading sensitivity to each can be achieved through 21-cm probes. We also make public our updates to the DM21cm code package that enable it to accommodate energy injection processes for general continuum spectra with arbitrary spatial and temporal dependence in an accompanying release.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We leverage the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations to test how the large-scale cosmic web shapes galaxy morphology and to forecast the early cosmic web structure that the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal. In the hydrodynamic TNG50 and $N$-body TNG50-Dark runs, we reconstruct the cosmic web at redshifts $z=0$, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine density estimator and the DisPerSE structure identification framework. We confirm that dark matter halos start out predominantly prolate (elongated) and their shapes are aligned with their nearest filaments; prolate galaxies retain strong shape-alignment with their outer halos to later times. The fraction of prolate galaxies and halos increases toward lower stellar mass, higher redshift, and lower-density filaments. Oblate and spheroidal galaxies show weaker trends with filament density, but spheroidal halos preferentially reside in higher-density filaments. We also find that higher-density filaments favor extended rotationally-supported disks, whereas lower-density filaments more often host smaller dispersion-supported systems. Then, generating mock galaxy samples from TNG100 and TNG50, we predict the early cosmic web accessible to Roman. We find that the spectroscopic emission-line depth planned for the High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey (HLWAS) yields a highly incomplete galaxy sample that does not accurately trace the $z=1$ cosmic web. A survey $\geq2.5\times$ deeper over a few square degrees would enable a proper reconstruction and reveal qualitatively correct filament-galaxy morphology relationships. Nevertheless, the planned HLWAS Deep field should still identify most galaxy overdensities; targeted deeper spectroscopy of these regions would efficiently and adequately map the early filamentary structure.</div>

Using galaxy samples at $z \in [2,6]$ derived from the COSMOS2020 and SC4K catalogs, we trained gradient-boosting machine-learning algorithms (LGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost) using optical and near-infrared broadband photometry. To ensure balanced performance, the models were trained on carefully selected datasets with similar redshift and i-band magnitude distributions. Additionally, the models were tested for robustness by perturbing the photometric data using the associated observational uncertainties. Our classification models achieved F1-scores of $\sim 87\%$ and successfully identified about $7,000$ objects with an unanimous agreement across all models. This more than doubles the number of LAEs identified in the COSMOS field compared with the SC4K dataset. We managed to spectroscopically confirm 60 of these LAE candidates using the publicly available catalogs in the COSMOS field. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in efficiently identifying LAEs candidates. This lays the foundations for applications to larger photometric surveys, such as Euclid and LSST. By complementing traditional approaches and providing robust preselection capabilities, our models facilitate the analysis of these objects. This is crucial to increase our knowledge of the overall LAE population.</div>

In particular, this nonlinearity may concern the unknown equation of state of dark energy $w(a)$, defined in the general $w(a)$CDM framework. Nevertheless, a common approach is the linearized approximation hereto notably $w_0w_a$CDM, also applied by DESI. Here, we consider a potential source of a systematic uncertainty in this linearization due to non-commutativity between $w_0w_a$CDM and {\it a posteriori} linearization of $w(a)$CDM, identified with a symmetry in the latter, which is violated in the former. We shall refer to these as early and late linearization, respectively. We demonstrate this in the analysis of the Hubble expansion in the Local Distance Ladder (LDL). Strikingly, opposite results are found for the evolution of dark energy by early versus late linearization, indicating a thawing or respectively, increasing dark energy. It is unlikely that the DESI pipeline is immune to the same contradiction. Our results show rather than thawing, claimed by DESI, dark energy may in fact be increasing. Further confirmation is expected from {\it Euclid}.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Axion inflation represents an intriguing source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.</div>

Roman&#39;s huge exoplanet haul, and Galactic reach, will require new methods to leverage the full exoplanet demographic content of the combined microlensing and transit samples, given the different sensitivity bias of the techniques to planet and host properties and Galactic location. We present a framework for technique-agnostic exoplanet demography (TAED) that can allow large, multi-technique exoplanet samples to be combined for demographic studies. Our TAED forward modelling and retrieval framework uses parameterised model exoplanet demographic distributions to embed planetary systems within a stellar population synthesis model of the Galaxy, enabling internally consistent forecasts to be made for all detection methods that are based on spatio-kinematic system properties. In this paper, as a first test of the TAED framework, we apply it to simulated transit datasets based on the Kepler Data Release 25 to assess parameter recovery accuracy and method scalability for a single large homogeneous dataset. We find that optimisation using differential evolution provides a computationally scalable framework that gives a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy of parameter recovery.</div>

In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation. The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then exclusion of non-Hellings \&amp; Downs templates is performed by the second cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim 40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim 1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of $\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$, respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the $3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset.</div>

Time domain analysis reveals that the dynamical evolution can be divided into three phases: the initial ringdown, the echo phase, and the final ringdown. The echo signals exhibit the periodic damping, with quantum effects significantly accelerating the echo dissipation and prompting an earlier transition to the long lived mode dominated phase. Furthermore, the QNM spectrum of the PS ECO exhibits fundamentally different behavior from that of BHs including the presence of long lived modes and the absence of overtone outbursts providing a clear spectroscopic signature distinguishing PS ECOs from BHs. This work is significant in providing new theoretical foundations and waveform features for identifying such quantum corrected ECOs, contributing critically to the understanding of quantum gravity effects.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Three-dimensional simulations of relativistic jets are a useful tool to understand the evolution of jets and radio galaxies in detail. However, computationally demanding as they are, their use is limited to a relatively small number of representative cases. When comparing to the distribution of large samples of objects in the luminosity-distance plane (P-D plane), the most efficient approach is to use analytical or semi-analytical models that reproduce the evolution of the main parameters governing the dynamics and radio luminosity of the sources. Our aim is to build a semi-analytical model that allows us to produce mock samples of radio galaxies to be compared with real populations and use this approach to constrain the general properties of active galaxies with jets in a cosmological context. In this work, we present a new model for the evolution of radio galaxies based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations and inspired both by previous experience on numerical simulations of jets across several orders of magnitude in power, and by observational evidence. Our results show remarkable agreement between the results given by the semi-analytical model and those obtained by both 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets ranging from 1.e35 W to 1.e39 W. From the derived trajectories of powerful radio galaxies through the P-D diagram (powers greater than 1.e36 W), our model agrees with typical lifetimes of galactic activity of &lt; 500 Myr. We also compare our results with previous models in the literature. In a follow-up paper, we use this model to generate mock populations of radio galaxies at low redshifts and compare them to the LoTSS sample.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational models with non-minimal couplings involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor have become increasingly popular. The idea of coupling the trace of the matter tensor to the geometry can be applied to various matter models, including relativistic perfect fluids. However, it is well-known that the variational formulation of perfect fluids involves some technicalities. We carefully derive the field equations including the trace coupling of a perfect fluid using two different approaches, namely, that given by Brown using Lagrange multipliers, and that given by Schutz using velocity potentials. We show that previous results involving such trace couplings do not match the results presented here. We demonstrate that our fluid&#39;s equations of motion are consistent with the gravitational field equations. Moreover, we present a simple on-shell argument which further supports the correctness of our results. Our work implies that a vast amount of the $f(R,T)$ literature using perfect fluids needs to be revisited.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\sim 25\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\gtrsim25\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information. This work presents a cross-correlation analysis between MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity mapping and Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys in $z=0.4\sim1.2$, which will share a survey area of several thousand square degrees. Utilizing Jiutian-1G cosmological simulation, we simulate the observational data of MeerKAT and CSST with survey areas from $\sim1600$ to $600$ deg$^2$ at $z=0.5$, 0.7, and 1. The effects of beam pattern, polarization leakage, and different foregrounds in the MeerKAT HI intensity mapping are considered in the simulation. After employing foreground removal with the principal component analysis (PCA) method and performing signal compensation, we derive the cross-power spectra of MeerKAT and CSST. We perform the joint constraint using the CSST galaxy auto-power spectra and MeerKAT-CSST cross-power spectra with the least-squares fitting method. The constraint results show that, in the simulated survey area, the relative accuracy can achieve $6\%\sim 8\%$ for the parameter products $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}b_{g}r_{\rm HI,g}$ and $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{\rm HI,g}$ at the three redshifts, which is $3\sim4$ times smaller than the current result. These findings indicate that the full MeerKAT-CSST joint observation with thousands of square degrees overlapping survey area can be a powerful probe of cosmic</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data, and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature, reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology, including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their target genes.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the potential of extreme mass-ratio inspirals to constrain quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black holes within the framework of loop quantum gravity. We consider a stellar-mass object orbiting a supermassive Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole in an equatorial eccentric trajectory. To explore the dynamical behavior of the system, we analyze its orbital evolution under gravitational radiation within the adiabatic approximation and the mass-quadrupole formula for different initial orbital configurations. Our results show that the quantum correction parameter $\hat{\alpha}$ slows down the evolution of the orbital semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then employ the numerical kludge method to generate the corresponding time-domain gravitational waveforms. To assess detectability, we include Doppler modulation due to the motion of space-based detectors and compute the frequency-domain characteristic strain. By evaluating mismatches between response signals for different values of $\hat{\alpha}$, we show that even small corrections $(\hat{\alpha} \sim 10^{-5})$ produce distinguishable effects. Our analysis suggests that future space-based detectors such as LISA can probe quantum gravitational corrections in the strong-field regime and place constraints significantly stronger than those from black hole shadow observations.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Along the last ten years, a general relativistic method has been developed to generate analytical expressions for the black hole (BH) parameters in terms of observations, namely the frequency shift of photons emitted by orbiting test particles and their positions on the sky. Applications of the method to astrophysical systems such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), in particular to megamaser systems orbiting the central BH on their flat accretion disks, showed a coupling behavior in the mass-to-distance ratio $M/D$. Estimates for the ratio $M/D$ of a sample of BHs hosted at the core of several AGNs have been performed in recent years with the help of this method. However, both analytical expressions and statistical estimations depend only on the $M/D$ ratio rather than on independent parameters. It is of current general interest to work with decoupled parameters in order to safeguard the intrinsic physical information encoded in each of them, given their high scientific relevance in understanding the structure of our Universe. The purpose of this work is to find analytical expressions for the mass and distance of a Schwarzschild BH in terms of astrophysical observations by introducing a slight warping in the accretion disk of the orbiting megamasers. As a result, independent analytical formulas for the mass and distance of AGN supermassive BHs are presented in terms of astrophysical observations: maser frequency shifts, disk parameters, and the galaxy&#39;s peculiar redshift.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Modelled searches for gravitational waves emitted by compact binary coalescences currently filter the data with template signals that ignore all effects related to the physics of dense-matter in neutron stars interiors, even when the masses in the template are compatible with a binary neutron star or a neutron star-black hole binary source. The leading neutron star finite-size effect is an additional phase contribution due to tidal deformations induced by the gravitational coupling between the two inspiralling objects in the binary. We show how neglecting this effect in the templates reduces the search sensitivity close to the detection threshold. This is particularly true for binary neutron stars systems, where tidal effects are larger. In this work we therefore propose a new technique for the construction of binary neutron star template banks that accounts for neutron star tidal deformabilities as degrees of freedom of the parameter space to be searched over. A first attempt in this direction was carried out by Harry &amp; Lundgren [Physical Review D 104, 043008 (2021)], who proposed to extract randomly the tidal deformabilities of the stars over a uniform interval, regardless of the binary neutron star component masses. We show that this approach yields 33% additional templates with respect to the equivalent point-like template bank. Our proposed approach, instead, adopts a more physically motivated tidal deformability prior with a support that is informed by the value of the neutron star mass and compatible with the neutron star equation of state constraint provided by the observation of GW170817. This method significantly reduces the needed additional templates to 8.2%.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Singly-ionized carbon is theorized to be the brightest emission line feature in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED). We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and $9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and $\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dust-lane spheroidal galaxies (DLSGs) are unique astrophysical systems that exhibit the morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) but are distinguished by prominent dust lanes. Recent studies propose that they form through minor mergers between ETGs and gas-rich dwarf galaxies, offering a window into the interstellar medium (ISM) of ETGs and star formation triggered by small-scale interactions. However, their rarity poses a challenge for assembling large, statistically robust samples via manual selection. To overcome this limitation, we employ GC-SWGAN, a semi-supervised learning method developed by \citet{2025ApJS..279...17L}, to systematically identify DLSGs within the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS). The methodology involves training a generative adversarial network (GAN) on unlabeled galaxy images to extract morphological features, followed by fine-tuning the model using a small dataset of labeled DLSGs. In our experiments, despite DLSGs constituting only $\sim$ 3.7\% of the test set, GC-SWGAN achieves remarkable performance, with an 87\% recall rate, 84\% accuracy, and an F1 score of 86\%, underscoring its efficacy for DLSG detection. Applying this model to $\sim$ 310,000 DESI-LS galaxies that meet the criteria $m_r &lt; 17.0$ and $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.07$ we compile the largest catalog of DLSG candidates to date, identifying 9,482 dust-lane ETGs. A preliminary analysis reveals that these DLSGs exhibit significantly redder $g-r$ colors and higher specific star formation rates compared to non-DLSGs. This catalog enables future studies of ISM properties in ETGs and the role of minor mergers in driving star formation in the nearby universe.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the generalized group orbit recovery model, where each observation is generated by applying a random group action and a known, fixed linear operator to an unknown signal, followed by additive noise. This model is motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and can be viewed primarily as a structured continuous Gaussian mixture model. In practice, signal estimation is often performed by marginalizing over the group using a uniform distribution--an assumption that typically does not hold and renders the MLE misspecified. This raises a fundamental question: how does the misspecified MLE perform? We address this question from several angles. First, we show that in the absence of projection, the misspecified population log-likelihood has desired optimization landscape that leads to correct signal recovery. In contrast, when projections are present, the global optimizers of the misspecified likelihood deviate from the true signal, with the magnitude of the bias depending on the noise level. To address this issue, we propose a joint estimation approach tailored to the cryo-EM setting, which parameterizes the unknown distribution of the group elements and estimates both the signal and distribution parameters simultaneously.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the hemispherical power asymmetry observed in the CMBR by attributing it to an early inhomogeneous phase of cosmic expansion. Unlike the conventional assumption of a perfectly isotropic and homogeneous pre-inflationary Universe, we introduce a small inhomogeneous perturbation, treated within a perturbative framework. Our analysis builds on previously developed empirical models of inhomogeneous primordial power spectrum models based on dipole modulation. Using in-in formalism, we compute two-point correlations directly from the metric and demonstrate that, at leading order, this introduces a direction-dependent power spectrum that breaks rotational symmetry and naturally selects a preferred direction, relating observed violation of the cosmological principle to inflationary power spectra arising from scalar field fluctuations. Additionally, we find that this framework produces correlations between multipoles separated by $\Delta l=1$, leading to distinctive signatures in the multipole space. Furthermore, we constrain the parameters of the inhomogeneous perturbation using observed PR4 \texttt{Commander} CMB data.</div>

We analyze the geodesic motion of both massless and massive test particles, highlighting how the NCS and DMH parameters affect the effective potentials, photon spheres, circular orbits, BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of test particles. Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase structure of the BH.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure. This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in neuroscience and beyond.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose an extension of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules, termed the Resonance sum rules (RSR), to access resonance poles in the complex energy plane. By strategically introducing a contour in the complex plane and conformal mapping, the method intends to reach resonance poles on the second Riemann sheet. To validate this approach, we apply RSR to the square-well potential model, for which the pole locations are known. The analysis demonstrates a successful extraction of the pole positions and residues for both the $S$-wave and $P$-wave resonances. The results are in good agreement with the analytic solutions, with discrepancies within $5\%$ for the pole positions and $20\%$ for the residues.This framework provides a basis for future applications to realistic hadronic resonances, promising new insights into spectral properties of QCD.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">These lectures aim to provide a basic introduction to dispersive methods and their modern applications to the phenomenology of the Standard Model at low energy. This approach exploits analyticity properties of Green functions and scattering amplitude, often combined with unitarity constraints. To find a logically coherent set of topics in this vast subject, I start with the two-point Green&#39;s function, show that this needs the three-point function as input which in turn needs the four-point function. The sequence stops here, just like these lectures, because the four-point function is related only to itself (if one ignores inelastic effects), I will discuss these dispersion relations both in the case of toy models, simple scalar theories, as well as in the phenomenologically relevant case of QCD.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Black-bounce (BB) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic parameters. In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of Einstein&#39;s equations in the BB context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gradient boosting is widely popular due to its flexibility and predictive accuracy. However, statistical inference and uncertainty quantification for gradient boosting remain challenging and under-explored. We propose a unified framework for statistical inference in gradient boosting regression. Our framework integrates dropout or parallel training with a recently proposed regularization procedure that allows for a central limit theorem (CLT) for boosting. With these enhancements, we surprisingly find that increasing the dropout rate and the number of trees grown in parallel at each iteration substantially enhances signal recovery and overall performance. Our resulting algorithms enjoy similar CLTs, which we use to construct built-in confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and rigorous hypothesis tests for assessing variable importance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms perform well, interpolate between regularized boosting and random forests, and confirm the validity of their built-in statistical inference procedures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">High-velocity collisions between gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxies present a promising formation channel for baryon-dominated dwarf galaxies (BDDGs). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that the progenitors&#39; baryonic binding energy, $|E_{\rm bind}|$, critically controls the outcome. Repeated potential fluctuations, e.g., from bursty feedback, inject energy and reduce $|E_{\rm bind}|$ by $\approx 15\%$, yielding fewer but substantially more massive BDDGs. By contrast, elastic self-interacting dark matter produces comparable cores without lowering $|E_{\rm bind}|$, resulting in negligible effect. This provides a novel way to distinguish between two leading galactic core formation channels, i.e., the baryon feedback and elastic dark matter self-interaction. Among 15 paired simulation runs, 13 show higher BDDG masses in the weakened-binding case, and about two thirds exhibit $&gt;100\%$ mass enhancements. The simulations also predict systematically lower gas fractions due to sustained post-collision star formation, yielding a clean observational signature. Upcoming wide-field imaging (CSST, LSST), HI surveys (FAST), and kinematic follow-up will be crucial to test this scenario.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this article we present a possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late 80-ties; and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. A generalization of the unimodularity principle to the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model was discussed in our recent paper, in which variational principle is formulated in 5 dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations was then presented and discussed. Here we present further developments of this approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of solutions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Monte Carlo methods are widely used for neutron transport simulations at least partly because of the accuracy they bring to the modeling of these problems. However, the computational burden associated with the slow convergence rate of Monte Carlo poses a significant challenge to running large-scale simulations. The continued improvement in high-performance computing capabilities has put exascale time-dependent Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations within reach. Variance reduction techniques have become an essential component to the efficiency of steady-state simulations, and population control techniques are an integral part of time-dependent simulations, but combining them can create algorithmic conflicts. This study investigates the performance of steady-state variance reduction techniques when extended to time-dependent problems and examines how variance reduction and population control techniques combine to impact the effectiveness of time-dependent simulations. Simulations were conducted using various combinations of these techniques across multiple test problems to assess their performance. While this study does not examine all possible variance reduction and population control combinations, the findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting algorithms to simulate large-scale time-dependent problems effectively. Notably, using weight windows with weight-based combing for population control can significantly hinder simulation performance, whereas pairing weight windows with uniform combing can provide the efficiencies necessary for successfully computing the results of massive problems. Further performance gains were observed when steady-state weight windows were replaced with time-dependent versions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics, provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads, PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization: it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii) Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406 contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked 22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across disciplines.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The high densities in the early Universe provide a unique laboratory to constrain couplings between feebly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos. In this article, we study how Big Bang Nucleosynthesis can constrain models of Ultra-Light Dark Matter diagonally coupled to neutrinos. We follow an adiabatic formalism which allows to average-out the rapid oscillations of the Dark Matter field and consistently take into account the feedback between the neutrino and the Dark Matter fields. This feedback alters the early Universe dynamics, causing the Dark Matter energy density to scale as radiation, while the neutrino mass scales as $a^{-1}$. These two effects modify primordial element abundances by modifying interaction rates and the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis. Then, we use primordial abundances to obtain leading cosmological bounds on the coupling in the range $m_\phi/{\rm eV}\in (10^{-22},10^{-17})$, namely $g\lesssim 0.13(m_\phi/{\rm eV})$ for $m_\phi \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$ and $g\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{-11}\sqrt{m_\phi/\rm eV}$ for $m_\phi \lesssim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$. This consistent cosmological treatment emphasizes that, in the mass interval where its physical assumptions hold, neutrino masses cannot be generated refractively by a direct coupling with an Ultra-Light Dark Matter field.</div>

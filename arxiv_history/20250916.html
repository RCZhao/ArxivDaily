                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822&#39;s outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity [abridged].</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">There is no consensus on how baryon feedback shapes the underlying matter distribution from either simulations or observations. We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel&#39;dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($08 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the &#34;Last Stand Before Rubin&#34; (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.</div>

To ensure that the model is consistent with the physically observed universe, we constrained the model parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis on joint datasets of cosmic chronometer and Pantheon samples. Using these approximated model parameter values, we investigated the universe&#39;s cosmic evolution history, including the deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, dark energy equation of state, total dark energy density parameters, universe age, and so on.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Despite the remarkable success of the standard LambdaCDM model in describing the evolution of the universe, several unresolved issues remain, such as the true nature of dark energy, fine-tuning problems, and the persistent Hubble tension. Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers an open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest observational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate the spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the LambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor fields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime interaction.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Quantum spread complexity characterizes how a quantum state evolves and becomes distributed over the Hilbert space under unitary dynamics. In this work, we employ a cost function as a quantitative measure of spread complexity. We investigate this cost function within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter, incorporating the $CP$-violation phase and Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) effects, under both normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. The cost function is evaluated for each scenario and analyzed with the corresponding neutrino transition probabilities for both initial muon neutrino and muon antineutrino flavor states. The results are presented using the energy where the first oscillation is maximum and baseline lengths of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, including T2K and NOvA, as well as upcoming experiments such as DUNE and P2O. Our findings indicate that the difference in the cost function between normal and inverted mass orderings during neutrino propagation in matter is sensitive to these experiments, with the appropriate choice of NSI parameters and the best-fit $CP$-violation phase values.</div>

We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as &#34;gold&#34;. According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</div>

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of &lt;0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The future space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA is expected to detect massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ranging up to thousands. Such high-precision observations require accurate modeling of the detector response. However, current derivations of the response function neglect the motion of the spacecraft during light travel time, omitting velocity-dependent terms of order $\beta = v/c \sim 10^{-4}$. In this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse. While small, these effects are comparable to current waveform modeling uncertainties and imprint distinctive sky-localization signatures, making them potentially relevant for parameter estimation of high-mass MBHBs and simulation of mock datasets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The periodic solution of the Friedmann equation in conformal time, implies that only cosmological perturbations exhibiting corresponding symmetries are physically permissible, leading to a discrete spectrum of allowed wave vectors. Furthermore, in a spatially closed universe, these wave vectors are independently constrained to be integers. Matching these two distinct quantization conditions provides a novel theoretical constraint on the possible values of spatial curvature. In this work, we numerically solve the cosmological perturbation equations, incorporating radiation anisotropy and higher-order Boltzmann terms, to calculate these discrete wave vectors with improved precision. Subsequently, we generate Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra for different characteristic spacings of these quantized wave vectors. Finally, we apply the constraint to Planck 2018 observational data to determine the cosmological parameters. This analysis yields a discrete set of allowed values for the spatial curvature, $\Omega_K$, including $[-0.076,-0.039, -0.024, -0.016, -0.012, \dots]$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce a novel numerical method to obtain the gluon splitting rates in an anisotropic QCD plasma in the AMY formalism, suitable for an anisotropic collision kernel. The method extends previous works by decomposing the additional angular information into Fourier modes, resulting in a significantly larger system of differential equations to solve numerically. It is then tested by calculating the rates for a simple anisotropic model for the collision kernel, which is compared to a thermal system. Remarkably, the obtained rates can be well-approximated by the rates calculated from an angular-averaged collision kernel, while still deviating significantly from equilibrium. An isotropic model for the collision kernel that is commonly used in QCD kinetic theory simulations, and which relies on the infrared temperature $T_*$ and an effective Debye mass, leads to rates that significantly deviate from the nonequilibrium rate, particularly at smaller parton energies.</div>

(gemini fallback)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the integral of a function on the unit sphere, in any dimension, using Monte Carlo methods. Although the methods we present are general, our guiding thread is the sliced Wasserstein distance between two measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is precisely an integral on the $d$-dimensional sphere. The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) has gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less computationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own right, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of dimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for the sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on quadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed, negative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted to the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate quadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs) and repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the literature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically benchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho estimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on UnifOrtho&#39;s success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large dimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final recommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use randomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \emph{UnifOrtho} in large dimensions. DPP-based quadratures only shine when quasi-Monte Carlo also does, while repelled quadratures show moderate variance reduction in general, but more theoretical effort is needed to make them robust.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Distance measurements using the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) rely on the bright-end power-law cut-off magnitude ($M^*$), which is defined by a number of the [OIII]$\lambda5007$-brightest planetary nebulae (PNe). In early-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the population is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star evolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs with known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the PNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using stellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation history, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the PNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of the PNLF ($\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological Simulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies. The average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are typically old ($9 &lt;\mathrm{Age}&lt; 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4 &lt;\mathrm{[M/H]}&lt; +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity in these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation between $\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages of 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with intermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies. We show that the presence of at least $\sim 2\%$ of stellar mass younger than 10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also present observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in ETGs.</div>

In this work, we employ numerical simulations and computational methods to investigate the asymptotic density and dynamical evolution mechanisms in Wolfram automata. We apply both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to identify the configurations associated with different Wolfram rules. Furthermore, we explore alternative initial conditions under which certain Wolfram rules generate similar fractal patterns over time, even when starting from a single active site. Our results reveal the relationship between the asymptotic density and the initial density of selected rules. The supervised learning methods effectively identify the configurations of various Wolfram rules, while unsupervised methods like principal component analysis and autoencoders can approximately cluster configurations of different Wolfram rules into distinct groups, yielding results that align well with simulated density outputs.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Clustering algorithms can help reconstruct the assembly history of the Milky Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework. We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\rm acc}\sim3$, for accreted + in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\rm acc} &lt; 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions, however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.</div>

Using state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations as the baseline for a comparison, we perform a detailed study of similarities and differences in existing event generators. We provide consistent setups for the simulations that can be used to obtain identical parametric precision in various programs used by experiments.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the matter power spectrum constraint on primordial black holes (PBH) by the dark matter (DM) emitted through Hawking radiation. We particularly focus on the scenario where PBH, with mass ranges between 1g and $10^9$g, evaporates before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Addition to that, we consider the case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination taking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is produced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold dark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples later on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts solely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium ever established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis is that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the mass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a protracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH evaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic and smooth out the small scale structure at much later time. By the precision measurement on the matter power spectrum from cosmic surveys, we are able to set joint constraint on light PBHs and the non-cold DMs it produced.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose an efficient algorithm for tensor PCA based on counting a specific family of weighted hypergraphs. For the order-$p$ tensor PCA problem where $p \geq 3$ is a fixed integer, we show that when the signal-to-noise ratio is $\lambda n^{-\frac{p}{4}}$ where $\lambda=\Omega(1)$, our algorithm succeeds and runs in time $n^{C+o(1)}$ where $C=C(\lambda)$ is a constant depending on $\lambda$. This algorithm improves a poly-logarithmic factor compared to previous algorithms based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy \cite{HSS15} or based on the Kikuchi hierarchy in statistical physics \cite{WEM19}. Furthermore, our result shows a smooth tradeoff between the signal-to-noise ratio and the computational cost in this problem, thereby confirming a conjecture posed in \cite{KWB22}.</div>

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present an investigation of the central structure of the S0 galaxy NGC 1553, to understand its origin and the underlying dynamical processes that shape it. The high-resolution integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) reveal a well-ordered rotation pattern, consisting of a rapidly rotating nuclear disc that is somewhat decoupled from the main disc, together with an inner lens; we collectively refer to these structures as the &#34;disc-lens&#34;. The central peak in the velocity dispersion indicates the presence of a classical bulge. The nuclear disc is dynamically colder than the surrounding disc, while the lens is dynamically hotter. The higher-order Gauss-Hermite moments, $h_{3}$ and $h_{4}$, further characterise the stellar kinematics. An anti-correlation between the line-of-sight velocity and skewness ($h_{3}$) is consistent with regular rotation. In contrast, the ring-like enhancement in kurtosis ($h_{4}$) confirms the presence of the nuclear disc component. Unsharp masking of HST images (Erwin et al. 2015) reveals a nuclear bar and faint spiral structures within the central 10 arcsec, supporting the role of secular evolution. The mass-weighted stellar age map shows an old stellar population in the central regions, with high metallicity that suggests the in-situ formation of the disc-lens from disc material. We discuss possible formation scenarios for the disc-lens, including both minor mergers and secular processes, and examine the influence of the Dorado group environment on NGC 1553. Our findings suggest that the disc-lens in NGC 1553 formed during the early stages of the galaxy&#39;s evolution. However, its subsequent development has been shaped by internal and external processes. These results provide new insights into the origin and evolution of kinematically distinct substructures in S0 galaxies.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Machine learning force fields possess unprecedented potential in achieving both accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. Nevertheless, their application in organic systems is often hindered by structural collapse during simulation and significant deviations in the prediction of macroscopic properties. Here, two physics-embedded strategies are introduced to overcome these limitations. First, a physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling method achieves long-timescale stable simulations by requiring only several tens of single-molecule data sets, and has been validated across molecular systems, including engineering fluids, polypeptides, and pharmaceuticals. Second, a top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on a physical equation is introduced. This strategy requires only a small amount of simulation data and completes the optimization of tunable parameters within a few hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU, significantly reducing errors in density and viscosity, as validated in systems including ethylene carbonate, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate. Together, these approaches directly integrate physical insights into the machine learning models, thereby enhancing robustness and generalizability, and providing a scalable pathway for physics-embedded machine learning force fields.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">X-rays emitted by high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and supernovae-driven winds in the first galaxies during Cosmic Dawn are expected to warm the intergalactic medium prior to its reionization. While most of the heating will be uniform on measurable scales, exceptionally bright sources will produce a warm ring around them with a distinctive 21-cm signature. The detection of such systems would confirm X-rays are a source of IGM heating during Cosmic Dawn and provide a test of models predicting higher X-ray luminosities per star formation rate compared with present-day galaxies. We illustrate the effect for a star-forming galaxy in a $10^{11}\, M_\odot$ halo at $z=12$, treating the photoionizing radiation and X-rays using a novel fully time-dependent 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer code. We consider a range in possible spectra for the HMXBs and star formation efficiencies, as well as the possible effect of an extended halo around the galaxy. We find detection of the signal would require integration times of a few thousand hours using SKA1-Low except for a bright galaxy like a starburst, but only a thousand hours for the expected noise levels of SKA2-Low. Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the 21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star formation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems clustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the surrounding gas.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution to the Einstein equations describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating spherically symmetric dust cloud with an arbitrary density profile and any distribution of initial velocities, encoded in three arbitrary functions $f(R)$, $F(R)$, and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$ is a radial coordinate in the comoving reference frame. A particular choice of these functions corresponds to a wormhole geometry with a throat defined as a sphere of minimum radius at a fixed time instant. In this paper we explore LTB wormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail the effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study photon motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled universe and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant observer. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence of its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the wormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow size decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the observer. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a dominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper presents a detailed analysis of the three-body final state interactions in the $B^+\to D\bar{D}K^+$ process, whose phase space is sufficient small. To precisely extract the resonance parameters, for instance the $\chi_{c0/2}(3930)$ in the $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass distributions, in this process, one has to take into account final state interaction, especially the three-body final state interaction. We employ the dispersive Khuri-Treiman formalism, combined with a parameterization of the $D\bar{D}$ interaction based on Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry. By performing a simultaneous fit to the experimental data from LHCb, BaBar, and Belle collaborations, the scheme with three-body interaction successfully describes the invariant mass distributions of the three two-body subsystems. We precisely extract the pole structures of $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ and $\psi(3770)$ as $3.913-0.018i~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3.764-0.002i~\mathrm{GeV}$ in $B^+$ decay. By performing the pole trajectory analysis on a uniformized complex plane, we find that both of them stem from the input bare state.</div>

Our main formula expresses the CDF in terms of Humbert&#39;s confluent hypergeometric function $\Phi_1$ and modified Bessel functions $K_\nu$, offering both theoretical elegance and computational efficiency. High-precision numerical experiments confirm pointwise agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and other benchmarks to machine accuracy. The resulting representation provides a tractable tool for applications in wireless fading channel modeling, nonlinear signal processing, statistics, finance, and applied probability.</div>

We also present a novel XAI tool B-ReX, based on the existing tool ReX, and demonstrate that it is superior to other black-box XAI tools on a large-scale benchmark.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert&#39;, an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert&#39; that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems. (Abridged.)</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent discoveries of dust and molecular gas in quiescent galaxies (QGs) up to $z\sim3$ challenge the long-standing view that the interstellar medium depletes rapidly once star formation ceases, raising key questions of whether dust and gas co-evolve in QGs, and how their depletion links to stellar aging. We present deep Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~6 continuum and CO(3--2) observations of 17 QGs at $z\sim0.4$ in the COSMOS field. Using the dust-to-molecular gas mass ratio ($\delta_{\rm DGR}$) as a key diagnostic, we trace post-quenching evolution of the cold interstellar medium. Our study triples the number of QGs with direct $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ estimates, constraining 12 systems with stellar population ages of $\sim$5--10 Gyr. For the first time, we show that $\delta_{\rm DGR}$ in QGs ranges from $\sim8\times$ below to $\sim2.5\times$ above the canonical value of $\delta_{\rm DGR}\sim1/100$. Despite uniformly low molecular gas fractions (median $f_{\rm H_2}=M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\star}\sim4.1\%$), QGs follow diverse evolutionary paths: about half exhibit rapid ($\sim700$ Myr) exponential dust decline with age, while the rest show mild decline over $\gtrsim$2 Gyr, maintaining elevated $\delta_{\rm DGR}\gtrsim1/100$. Our results support simulations predictions of dust and molecular gas evolving independently post-quenching, without a preferred quenching mode. This challenges the use of dust continuum as a $\rm H_2$ tracer, implying that quenching cannot be robustly linked to interstellar medium conditions when relying solely on dust or gas.</div>

Advances in AI leading to AI agents show exciting new opportunities that can accelerate scientific discovery by providing intelligence as a component in the ecosystem. However, it is unclear how this new capability would materialize and integrate in the real world. To address this, we propose a conceptual framework where workflows evolve along two dimensions which are intelligence (from static to intelligent) and composition (from single to swarm) to chart an evolutionary path from current workflow management systems to fully autonomous, distributed scientific laboratories. With these trajectories in mind, we present an architectural blueprint that can help the community take the next steps towards harnessing the opportunities in autonomous science with the potential for 100x discovery acceleration and transformational scientific workflows.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in learning on graph-structured data, yet a principled understanding of why they succeed or fail remains elusive. While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to extract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically between similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of generalisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on unlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error bounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single architecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in practice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact generalisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through the lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as graph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By focusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we derive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs, including convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact characterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned information between node features and graph structure contributes to generalisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on generalisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs can effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical guidance for model selection.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case. Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical simulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we analyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the black hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical -- critical exponents, differing by about $2\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist. Our findings provide direct numerical evidence for the near universality of the critical exponent in PBH formation, with only mild dependence on whether the collapse is driven by a scalar field or a perfect fluid.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.</div>

Our construction ensures purely Dirac neutrinos with a minimal scalar sector, naturally generating neutrino masses without requiring unnaturally tiny couplings. The model demonstrates its predictive power by simultaneously reproducing the charged lepton mass hierarchy and predicting neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences consistent with their global best fit values. It further predicts a sum of neutrino masses consistent with the current cosmological bound, while predicting maximal Dirac CP violation.

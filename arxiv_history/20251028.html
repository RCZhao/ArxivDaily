                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We report the first direct measurement of galaxy assembly bias, a critical systematic in cosmology, from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey. We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. In this work, we present one of the first direct observational tests of luminosity-dependent assembly bias using a large sample of galaxy clusters with spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements, we find evidence for assembly bias: brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the $3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby confirming the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors, and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches for generic GWTs.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals&#39; complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in mathematical reasoning.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmic birefringence (CB) is a promising probe of parity-violating physics beyond the Standard Model, characterized by the rotation of the linear polarization plane of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This effect, quantified by the birefringence angle $\beta$, generates non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ correlations that are otherwise absent in standard cosmology. However, instrumental miscalibration angles $\alpha$ can mimic this signal, necessitating a joint estimation approach. In this work, we forecast the sensitivity of the AliCPT experiment, combined with Planck HFI data, on constraining the isotropic CB angle using a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood method. We simulate observations under various foreground complexities, rotation angles, and scanning strategies, and demonstrate that AliCPT can achieve an uncertainty of $\sigma(\beta)=0.09^\circ$ with one-year data, which will improve to $0.026^\circ$ after four years&#39; observations. We also find that neglecting or mismodeling the foreground $EB$ correlation will introduce significant biases, which can be alleviated under a clean but small sky patch.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce WimPyC, a Python code for the calculation of the capture rate of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by celestial bodies through nuclear scattering in the optically thin regime. WimPyC is an extension of the WimPyDD code, that calculates WIMP-nucleus scattering signals in direct detection (DD) experiments, and allows to combine DD and capture in celestial bodies in virtually any scenario within the framework of Galilean-invariant non-relativistic effective theory (NREFT), including inelastic scattering, an arbitrary WIMP spin and a generic WIMP velocity distribution in the Galactic halo. WimPyDD and WimPyC are suitable for both top-down approaches, where the interaction operators of a high-energy physics model are matched to those of the NREFT, and to bottom-up studies, where the Wilson coefficients of the NREFT are explored in a model-independent way and/or where the velocity distribution is written in terms of a superposition of streams taken as free parameters. As in the case of WimPyDD WimPyC exploits the factorization of the three main components that enter in the calculation of the capture rate: i) the Wilson coefficients that encode the dependence of the signals on the ultraviolet completion of the effective theory; ii) a response function that depends on the nuclear physics; iii) the halo function that depends on the WIMP velocity distribution. In WimPyC these three components are calculated and stored separately for later interpolation and combined together only as the last step of the signal evaluation procedure. This makes the phenomenological study of the capture rate with WimPyC transparent and improves computational speed.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity are capable of solving the Hubble tension while producing consistency with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three different forms for the $f(Q)$ function: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We also consider extensions of these models by adding the Cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible double exponential addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI DR2 BAO, Planck 2018, Local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometers data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent models do not provide an adequate solution, while the exponential model gives a reasonable solution, though it faces mild tension with the BAO data. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better than the exponential, at the cost of reduced theoretical motivation. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while producing BAO consistency. The phenomenological models are able to achieve a good fit to all data, giving guidelines for what a background solution to the Hubble tension would look like in general.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Gravitational-wave (GW) events are generally believed to originate in galaxies and can thus serve, like galaxies, as tracers of the universe&#39;s large-scale structure. In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and $4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The redshifted 21-cm signal from the dark ages offers a powerful probe of cosmological models and the underlying dark matter microphysics. We investigate deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction, an absorption trough of approximately $-40.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at redshift $z \simeq 85.6$, in the context of co-SIMP dark matter. The strength of co-SIMP interactions, quantified by the parameter $C_{\rm int}$, enhances the absorption depth and shifts the trough to higher redshifts. For example, a model with $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ produces a minimum brightness temperature of $-50.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at $z \simeq 86.2$. The 21-cm power spectrum increases with $C_{\rm int}$ in addition to the global signal. We assess the detectability of these signatures using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher matrix forecasts. The maximum SNR reaches $\sim 15.7$ for $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ for the global signal. Fisher forecast for $1,000$ hours of integration time shows that this model can be distinguished from a null-signal at $4.3\sigma$ and from the $\Lambda$CDM model case at $1.6 \sigma$, with order-of-magnitude improvements for 100,000 hours of integration. For the 21-cm power spectrum, our forecasts reveal complementary trends; with a modest setup (collecting area of $5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ and 1,000 hours of integration time), the $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ model can be detected at $4.63\sigma$ and differentiated from the standard scenario at $1.78 \sigma$. These findings highlight the potential of the 21-cm cosmology to probe the properties of dark matter and demonstrate that upcoming dark ages experiments, particularly space-based and lunar observations, can offer a promising avenue to test co-SIMP models.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts, static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space of the model&#39;s current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead, making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices via sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$ through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. Several examples and applications are presented.</div>

The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25 experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)- a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task (M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method (M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and genetic algorithm.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We propose a novel foundation for calculus that focuses on the notion of approximations while avoiding the use of limits altogether. Continuity is defined as approximation at a point, while differentiability is defined as approximation with a linear function. The errors in approximation are defined as a class of functions with certain properties; rules for combining error functions lead to all the familiar results in differential calculus. We believe that this approach is more natural for students while still giving a rigourous foundation to differential calculus. We demonstrate its utility by deriving the basic differential rules for trigonometric, hyperbolic and exponential functions, as well as L&#39;H\^opital&#39;s Rule, Taylor polynomials, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, all via approximation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the consistency of radiatively corrected inflationary models with both the latest observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) combined with Planck 2018 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the theoretical constraints imposed by the swampland program. We systematically test two distinct models against three key swampland conjectures: the further refined de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRDSSC), the scalar weak gravity conjecture (SWGC), and the strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation, satisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational constraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, $r &lt; 0.038$), but fails to meet the SWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with quantum gravity principles. In contrast, Model II, incorporating radiative corrections with scalar sectors, demonstrates full consistency by satisfying all three swampland conjectures simultaneously while maintaining observational viability. The compatibility of Model II is highly sensitive to the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and renormalization scales $\mu_b$, with larger values extending the range of swampland-consistent solutions. Our results highlight the critical role of radiative corrections in achieving simultaneous theoretical and observational consistency, and identify Model II as a promising candidate for a fully viable inflationary scenario within the swampland framework. This work provides a methodology for classifying inflationary models based on their swampland compatibility, demonstrating that satisfaction of the FRDSSC alone is insufficient for full theoretical consistency.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce $\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$ speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational bottlenecks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Methods. We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON between 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into the Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We assess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element calculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published Geminid measurements. Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data reduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values. However, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL, DFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift in right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the precession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to overestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model used as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a well-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are low-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity. On the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities, particularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes for the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or more. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity uncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between their trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary systematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS, FRIPON, and DFN.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously. However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers, each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers. Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant. Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation, we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES over prior methods.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied, defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions, which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work, we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor. Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without sacrificing predictive accuracy.</div>

Many of the existing methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.</div>

Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\&#34;om (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Does cosmic ray (CR) pressure matter for the circumgalactic medium (CGM)? Despite growing interest, this remains a debated question, complicated by limited observational constraints and differing implementations of CR physics in simulations. While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and dynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains underexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped cold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. Using high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find that CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds. Specifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface area and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in mass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the central galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to the no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass in the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in simulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal gas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating the cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability to feed galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned external knowledge to override the model&#39;s internal memory. While existing attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG, they largely ignore the model&#39;s internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning, a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons. Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time, Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method effectively resolves knowledge conflict.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures. Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved confounders exist.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of supernova SN 2025wny, associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821. Photometric monitoring from the Lulin and Maidanak observatories confirms multiple point-like images, consistent with SN 2025wny being strongly lensed by two foreground galaxies. Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time, the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the &#34;perturber&#34;) to be z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN 2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for independent measurements of the Hubble constant. Following a tradition in the field of strongly-lensed SNe, we give SN 2025wny the nickname SN Winny.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Double radio relics, pairs of diffuse radio features located on opposite sides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are believed to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma acceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision (TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration, and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience, statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner platform</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Schr\&#34;odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations like Diffusion Schr\&#34;odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical guarantees for DSBM.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs, EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in gravitational wave experiments.</div>

By using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state parameter $\omega$.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of regular black holes, driven by the search for singularity-free geometries. This research has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization mechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field theory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs. We propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method explored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity suppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a coordinate remapping $r \rightarrow\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism proposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric. The method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function, smoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under specific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular spacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature invariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the regularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical consistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black hole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution. The method provides a unified framework to systematically generate singularity-free black holes within classical general relativity</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case, $t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density. Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target distributions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Observations suggest that UV-bright, compact star-forming galaxies produce enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet, the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time, the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm, the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods. Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis. However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies the states of the system under consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.</div>

The development work carried out for this project facilitated further even more involved analytic five-loop computations. We briefly summarize also their numerical QCD results for Higgs-boson decay to hadrons in the heavy-top limit and for two N$^4$LO splitting functions for the evolution of quark distributions of hadrons.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching (CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along the ontological hierarchy. We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score, outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare. However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e., an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The multivariate Kendall-$\tau$ statistic, denoted by $K_n$, plays a significant role in robust statistical analysis. This paper establishes the limiting properties of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $K_n$. We demonstrate that the ESD of $\frac{1}{2}pK_n$ converges almost surely to the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur law with variance parameter $\frac{1}{2}$, analogous to the classical result for sample covariance matrices. Using Stieltjes transform techniques, we extend these results to the independent component model, deriving a fixed-point equation that characterizes the limiting spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{2}tr\Sigma K_n$. The theoretical findings are validated through comprehensive simulation studies.</div>

We investigate the possibility that Coriolis fields mimic dark matter effects in disk galaxies. We find solutions from their field equations that sustain the velocity rotation curves in the bulge region and beyond it, notably describing flattish velocity profiles. We dub such solutions Dark Coriolis Fields.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a node&#39;s Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic to the game&#39;s reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies, which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs&#39; Q-values of the search tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances obtained by optimizing all available parameters.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies -- WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P -- using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such agents, ranging from general-purpose &#34;deep research&#34; systems to specialized science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3) do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access; (4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders. Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">A number of cosmic shear studies have reported results that are in mild tension with the Planck cosmic microwave measurement. To explore if this can be caused by biases in the shear estimation, we revisit the analysis of data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using an alternative shape measurement pipeline that is more robust to uncertainties in the calibration. To this end, we present an implementation of MetaCalibration, and compare its performance to that of lensfit, which has been used in previous analyses of these data. We find that the multiplicative bias is reduced, especially for the most distant redshifts, as derived from multi-band image simulations designed to match the KiDS data (SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations: SKiLLS). For all tomographic bins we obtain a multiplicative bias $|m|&lt;0.017$, with negligible additive bias. Importantly, the calibration has a negligible sensitivity to key galaxy properties. The resulting robust shear estimates were used to obtain cosmological parameter constraints. We find that the parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3} =0.789_{-0.024}^{+0.020}$ is consistent with the previous KiDS-1000 lensfit constraint of $S_8=0.776^{+0.029 +0.002}_{-0.027-0.003}$ (statistical + systematic errors). Thanks to the higher effective source density, the constraining power is improved by about 28%. The difference in $S_8$ with the Planck value remains at a similar level, 1.8$\sigma$, implying that it is not caused by the shear measurements.</div>

We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at $6.5\leq z \leq 7.5$ covering $-22.6 \leq M_{\rm UV} \leq -20.2$, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching $5\,\sigma$ depths of $26.3$), yielding 140 galaxies in $0.65 \, \rm{deg}^2$, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee ($M^*=-21.14^{+0.28}_{-0.25}$). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at $M_{\rm UV}7$ suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at $z&gt;9$. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at $J_{\rm E} &lt; 24.5$. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper accompanies Data Release 4 of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), which presents the full NIRSpec spectroscopy of the survey. We provide spectra of 5190 targets across GOODS-North and GOODS-South (including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), observed with the low-dispersion (R $\sim$ 30-300) prism and three medium-resolution (R $\sim$ 1000) gratings spanning 0.8 $$ 4400 galaxies in the Medium tiers. Targets were selected from photometric redshifts or colours, with priority given to rest-UV-selected galaxies at $z &gt; 5.7$ and F444W-selected galaxies at $1.5 5.7$ and 2545 at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. To facilitate uniform analyses, we define &#39;gold&#39; sub-samples based on UV- and F444W-selection. Using the parent samples and redshift success rates, we construct rest-UV luminosity functions at $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ from the Medium- and Deep-JWST tiers. Our number densities agree well with previous determinations from both photometric and spectroscopic samples, with modest interloper fractions confirming the reliability of photometric UV-bright galaxy selections at these redshifts.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Weak gravitational lensing signals of optically identified clusters are impacted by a selection bias -- halo triaxiality and large-scale structure along the line of sight simultaneously boost the lensing signal and richness (the inferred number of galaxies associated with a cluster). As a result, a cluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than expected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This selection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters derived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass calibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and Cardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the selection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at a 20-50% level, with a larger bias 20-80% for large-scale lensing (&gt;3 Mpc). Even with a conservative projection model, the impact of selection bias significantly outweighs the impact of other currently known cluster lensing systematics. We urge the cluster community to account for this bias in all future optical cluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Using deep observations across three of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies (SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.</div>

The core of ELENA is based on a vectorized implementation of the tunnelling potential formalism, which allows for a fast computation of the finite-temperature tunnelling action. This, in turn, enables the sampling of the full range of temperatures where two phases coexist and the use of integral expressions that track the complete evolution of the transition, providing a comprehensive picture of it. In addition, ELENA provides all the tools to compute the resulting stochastic gravitational waves spectrum, allowing for the full chain of computations - from the Lagrangian parameter inputs to the final gravitational waves spectrum - in a fast and self-contained implementation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection is essentially limited to $z \lesssim 0.42$ due to the faintness of the 21cm line. Detections beyond this redshift have made use of the stacking technique to obtain average quantities of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known 50 cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral line profile. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to 1.58 requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detection of HI emission in galaxies where strong lensing has been observed in the optical appears to be more promising with potential for a $5\sigma$ detection in $&lt;50$ hours of on-source observations for Abell 370 and in $&lt;75$ hours for Abell 1703 with the uGMRT.</div>

However, these simulations are computationally very expensive and time-consuming to produce in large numbers. To overcome this problem, an efficient field-level emulator of this signal is required. However, the EoR 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian; therefore, capturing the correlations between different scales of this signal, which is directly related to the evolution of the reionization, with the neural network is quite difficult. Here, we introduce CosmoUiT, a UNet integrated vision transformer-based architecture, to overcome these difficulties. CosmoUiT emulates the 3D cubes of 21-cm signal from the EoR, for a given input dark matter density field, halo density field, and reionization parameters. CosmoUiT uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism of the transformer to capture the long-range dependencies and convolutional layers in the UNet to capture the small-scale variations in the target 21-cm field. Furthermore, the training of the emulator is conditioned on the input reionization parameters such that it gives a fast and accurate prediction of the 21-cm field for different sets of input reionization parameters. We evaluate the predictions of our emulator by comparing various statistics (e.g., bubble size distribution, power spectrum) and morphological features of the emulated and simulated maps. We further demonstrate that this vision transformer-based architecture can emulate the entire 3D 21-cm signal cube with high accuracy at both large and small scales.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Bayes factors have become a popular tool in exoplanet spectroscopy for testing atmosphere models against one another. We show that the commonly used method for converting these values into significance &#34;sigmas&#34; is invalid. The formula is neither justified nor recommended by its original paper, and overestimates the confidence of results. We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula. In order to avoid overstating observational results and estimating observation times too low, the community should return to the standard Bayesian interpretation.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the launch and application of next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes, astronomy has entered the era of big data, necessitating more efficient and robust data analysis methods. Most traditional parameter estimation methods are unable to reconcile differences between photometric systems. Ideally, we would like to optimally rely on high-quality observation data provided by, e.g., JWST, for calibrating and improving upcoming wide-field surveys such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Euclid. To this end, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient Parameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and efficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER). As a test of the methodology, we focus on galaxies at $z\sim 1.5-2.5$. To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and the training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from each cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric catalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply this JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited sample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived parameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using extended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and Euclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR estimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$ (0.25 vs. 0.35). With its computational efficiency capable of processing $10^6$ sources per CPU per hour during the estimation phase, this JWST-calibrated estimator holds significant promise for next-generation wide-field surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Mounting evidence indicates that some of the gravitational wave signals observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observatories might arise from eccentric compact object binaries, increasing the urgency for accurate waveform models for such systems. While for non-eccentric binaries, surrogate models are efficient and accurate, the additional features due to eccentricity have posed a challenge. In this letter, we present a novel method for decomposing eccentric numerical relativity waveforms which makes them amenable to surrogate modelling techniques. We parameterize the inspiral in the radial phase domain, factoring out eccentricity-induced dephasing and thus enhancing compressibility and accuracy. This is combined with a second surrogate for the merger-ringdown in the time-domain and a novel technique to take advantage of the approximate periodicity with radial oscillations during the inspiral. We apply this procedure to the $(2,2)$ mode for non-spinning black hole binaries, and demonstrate that the resulting surrogate, NRSurE_q4NoSpin_22, is able to faithfully reproduce the underlying numerical relativity waveforms, with maximum mismatches of $5\times10^{-4}$ and median mismatches of $2\times10^{-5}$. This technique paves the way for high-accuracy parameter estimation with eccentric models, a key ingredient for astrophysical inference and tests of general relativity.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</div>

In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Dusty, submillimeter-selected galaxies without optical counterparts contribute a non-negligible fraction of the star formation in the early universe. However, such a population is difficult to detect through classical optical/UV-based surveys. We report the serendipitous discovery of such an optically dark galaxy, behind the quadruply-lensed $z=2.56$ quasar, H1413+117, offset to the north by 6\arcsec. From $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3, $J=6$--5, and part of the $J=13$--12 transitions, which all spatially coincide with a compact submillimeter continuum emission, we determine an unambiguous spectroscopic redshift, $z=3.386\pm 0.005$. This galaxy has a molecular mass $M_{\rm mol} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and a black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$, estimated from $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3 and archival {\it Chandra} X-ray data ($L_{\rm 2-10,keV} \sim 4 \times 10^{44}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), respectively. We also estimate a total infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR} = (2.8\pm{2.3}) \times 10^{12}$ L$_\odot$ and a stellar mass of $M_* \lesssim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, from spectral energy distribution fitting. According to these simple mass estimations, this gas-rich and X-ray bright galaxy might be in a transition phase from starburst to quasar offering a unique case for studying galaxy-black hole co-evolution under extremely dusty conditions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Exoplanetary science heavily relies on transit depth ($D$) measurements. Yet, as instrumental precision increases, the uncertainty on $D$ appears to increasingly drift from expectations driven solely by photon-noise. Here we characterize this shortfall (the Transit-Depth Precision Problem, TDPP), by defining an amplification factor, $A$, quantifying the discrepancy between the measured transit-depth uncertainty and the measured baseline scatter on a same time bin size. While in theory $A$ should be $\sim\sqrt{3}$, we find that it can reach values $\gtrsim$10 notably due to correlations between $D$ and the limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs). This means that (1) the performance of transit-based exoplanet studies (e.g., atmospheric studies) can be substantially improved with reliable priors on LDCs and (2) low-fidelity priors on the LDCs can yield substantial biases on $D$--potentially affecting atmospheric studies due to the wavelength-dependence of such biases. For the same reason, biases may emerge on stellar-density and planet-shape/limb-asymmetry measurements. With current photometric precisions, we recommend using a 3$^{\rm rd}$-order polynomial law and a 4$^{\rm th}$-order non-linear law, as they provide an optimal compromise between bias and $A$, while testing the fidelity for each parametrization. While their use combined with existing LDC priors (10-20% uncertainty) currently implies $A\sim10$, we show that targeted improvements to limb-darkening models can bring $A$ down to $\sim2$. Improving stellar models and transit-fitting practices is thus essential to fully exploit transit datasets, and reliably increasing their scientific yield by $5\times$, thereby enabling the same science with up to $25\times$ fewer transits.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Reconstruction of displaced vertices is a cornerstone of both precision flavour physics and searches for long-lived particles (LLPs) at colliders. While existing vertexing algorithms are highly optimised for primary and short-lived secondary vertices, they face limitations when confronted with the large displacements and heterogeneous topologies characteristic of LLP decays. In this work we present a new approach to displaced vertex reconstruction combining an initialisation-free robust vertex fitter with a graph-based track clustering strategy. The algorithm is implemented as a self-contained Delphes module and can be straightforwardly integrated into existing detector cards, providing a turn-key tool for phenomenological studies. This plug-and-play functionality fills a gap left by public software frameworks, which either lack displaced-vertex capabilities or are not readily usable in fast-simulation environments. We validate our approach in an IDEA-like FCC-ee detector, using Higgs-strahlung $e^+e^- \to Zh$ with exotic $h\to NN$ decays as a benchmark process. We demonstrate excellent efficiency, resolution, and purity across a broad range of lifetimes, and derive model-independent projections for the FCC-ee sensitivity to exotic Higgs branching fractions.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the increasing demand for interpretability in machine learning, functional ANOVA decomposition has gained renewed attention as a principled tool for breaking down high-dimensional function into low-dimensional components that reveal the contributions of different variable groups. Recently, Tensor Product Neural Network (TPNN) has been developed and applied as basis functions in the functional ANOVA model, referred to as ANOVA-TPNN. A disadvantage of ANOVA-TPNN, however, is that the components to be estimated must be specified in advance, which makes it difficult to incorporate higher-order TPNNs into the functional ANOVA model due to computational and memory constraints. In this work, we propose Bayesian-TPNN, a Bayesian inference procedure for the functional ANOVA model with TPNN basis functions, enabling the detection of higher-order components with reduced computational cost compared to ANOVA-TPNN. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and demonstrate that Bayesian-TPNN performs well by analyzing multiple benchmark datasets. Theoretically, we prove that the posterior of Bayesian-TPNN is consistent.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of Hawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through cosmic dawn.</div>

Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In this work, first we examine the energy conditions in the context of the generalized metric-Palatini hybrid gravity, known as $f(R, {\cal R})$ gravity. We show that for the proposed model in this study, {\it i.e.} $ f(R, {\cal R})= R +\alpha{\cal R}^{n} $, one of the four fundamental energy conditions, specifically the strong energy condition, does not hold for some values of $n$. Therefore, it seems that hybrid gravity can provide a model for the accelerated expansion of the universe. In continuation of completing our study in this work, we try to analyze the impact of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity on the gravitational baryogenesis process. The hybrid metric-Palatini model combines two gravitational theories that allow for a more detailed examination of the behavior of space-time and its interaction with matter. This combination is critical in the early radiation-dominant universe, where unusual gravitational effects may play a key role in generating baryonic asymmetry and the production of baryons and anti-baryons.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the framework of entropic cosmology, entropic forces arising at the cosmological horizon have been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the Universe&#39;s current accelerated phase. However, recent studies have shown that, under the Clausius relation and assuming a linear mass-to-horizon (MHR) relation, all entropic force models reduce to the original Bekenstein-Hawking formulation, regardless of the specific form of the horizon entropy. As a result, they inherit the same observational limitations in accounting for cosmic dynamics. To address this issue, a generalized MHR has been introduced, providing the foundation for a modified cosmological scenario rooted in the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. In this work, we explore the implications of this generalized framework for early-Universe dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the growth of matter perturbations within the spherical Top-Hat formalism in the linear regime, showing that the density contrast profile is significantly influenced by the modified background dynamics predicted by the model. Moreover, considering the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the sub-$10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$ range, we examine the impact on the relic abundance of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying parameter regions where deviations from standard cosmology may arise through an enhanced PGW spectrum.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $&gt;90\%$ even when trained on only $20\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Numerical relativity (NR) provides the most accurate waveforms for comparable-mass binary black holes but becomes prohibitively expensive for increasingly asymmetric mass ratios. Point-particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT), which expands the Einstein equations in the small-mass-ratio limit, offers a computationally efficient alternative but is expected to break down in the comparable-mass regime because it neglects nonlinear effects. Nonetheless, several recent studies have shown that ppBHPT can model non-spinning binaries with high accuracy when supplemented by simple calibrations or a first post-adiabatic (PA) correction. Here we assess the applicability of ppBHPT to quasi-circular binaries with a spinning primary by comparing waveform amplitudes, orbital frequencies, and orbital phases. We find that spin effects in ppBHPT waveforms (without additional spin information beyond adiabatic order) are in surprisingly close agreement with the corresponding NR calculation (outperforming some post-Newtonian models) over the last $\approx 20$ orbital cycles. This suggests that, after incorporating higher-order corrections into ppBHPT waveforms in the non-spinning limit -- via second-order self-force results or semi-analytical fits -- only modest spin-dependent adjustments may be required to achieve NR-faithful ppBHPT waveforms. We also show that combining non-spinning NR information with adiabatic ppBHPT can provide a reasonably accurate inspiral waveform for spins $\chi \lesssim 0.5$ mass ratios $q \gtrsim 5$.</div>

A companion paper presents the target selection, spectroscopic redshifts and success rates, and in this paper, we discuss the data reduction and present emission line flux measurements. The spectroscopy in this work consists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190 targets, covering the spectral range $0.6\text{--}5.5$~\mum and observed with both the low-dispersion prism ($R=30\text{--}300$) and all three medium-resolution gratings ($R=500\text{--}1,500$). We describe the data reduction, analysis and description of the data products included in this data release. In total, we measured 3,297 robust redshifts out of 5,190 targets, spanning a redshift range from $z=0.5$ up to $z=14.2$, including 974 at $z&gt;4$. This data release includes 1-d and 2-d fully reduced spectra with 3 and 5 pixel extractions, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. Furthermore, we provide redshifts and $S/N&gt;5$ emission-line flux catalogues for the prism and grating spectra, as well as new guidelines to use these data products. Lastly, we are launching a new JADES Online Database, designed to enable quick selection and browsing of this data release. Altogether, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterise the properties of galaxy populations across Cosmic time.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters (GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1 observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We study the inflationary gravitational wave background induced by Abelian gauge fields generated by non-minimal kinetic and axial couplings to the inflaton. We show that the gravitational wave spectrum is scale invariant and derive its amplitude for generic gauge field coupling parameters, within the slow-roll approximation. We constrain the coupling values and the scale of inflation for which the induced gravitational wave background is observable, while ensuring that back-reaction on the inflationary dynamics remains negligible. We find that a sizeable axial coupling can boost this secondary gravitational wave signal above the standard inflationary background. In the course of our analysis, we also show how to analytically match tensor perturbations across an arbitrary number of eras with different equations of state.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Bayesian optimal experimental design provides a principled framework for selecting experimental settings that maximize obtained information. In this work, we focus on estimating the expected information gain in the setting where the differential entropy of the likelihood is either independent of the design or can be evaluated explicitly. This reduces the problem to maximum entropy estimation, alleviating several challenges inherent in expected information gain computation. Our study is motivated by large-scale inference problems, such as inverse problems, where the computational cost is dominated by expensive likelihood evaluations. We propose a computational approach in which the evidence density is approximated by a Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo surrogate, while the differential entropy is evaluated using standard methods without additional likelihood evaluations. We prove that this strategy achieves convergence rates that are comparable to, or better than, state-of-the-art methods for full expected information gain estimation, particularly when the cost of entropy evaluation is negligible. Moreover, our approach relies only on mild smoothness of the forward map and avoids stronger technical assumptions required in earlier work. We also present numerical experiments, which confirm our theoretical findings.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the star formation and dust attenuation properties for a sample of 602 galaxies at redshifts $\rm{3&lt;z&lt;7}$, as part of the JADES survey. Our analysis is based on measurements of the $\rm{H}\alpha/\rm{H}\beta$ Balmer Decrement using medium resolution (R$\sim$1000) spectroscopic observations with the JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly. Stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are inferred with \texttt{Prospector} using deep multi-band imaging. We utilize the Balmer decrement to measure dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based SFRs, taking into account the subsolar metallicities observed in galaxies at high redshift. We confirm, with our large sample size, that the correlation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass is already established out to $z\sim7$. We find that the relation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass does not significantly evolve from the local universe to $z\sim7$. We investigate the UV slope as a function of the Balmer optical depth and find that the best-fit correlation for our high redshift sample is sSFR dependent and significantly different at high redshift when compared to galaxies at $z\approx 0$ and $z \approx 2$. For the highest sSFR galaxies in our sample, there is no significant correlation between the UV slope and Balmer optical depth. This is evidence that the UV slope should be used with great caution to correct for dust in high redshift galaxies.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects&#39; properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories&#39; predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics.

Our calculation includes contributions from the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), solar neutrinos, and reactor antineutrinos, accounting for coherent scattering processes across nuclear, atomic, and macroscopic length scales. Within the Standard Model, we find negligible decoherence rates for planned experiments such as MAQRO ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-27}$) and terrestrial interferometers like Pino ($s/\sigma_s \sim 10^{-22}$). However, these experiments achieve competitive sensitivity to beyond-Standard Model physics through light vector mediator interactions, with C$\nu$B constraining coupling products to $g_\nu g_n \lesssim 10^{-17}$ for $Z&#39;$ masses below 1 eV.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i) straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive simulations and a real-data application.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Study of parton distribution functions (PDFs) has led to a finer cognisance of the structure of partons in hadrons and the proton structure functions in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). PDFs are instrumental in predicting results for most of the hard-scattering processes measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, due to the non-perturbative nature of partons, calculation of parton distributions using perturbative QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) cannot be done. The analysis of PDFs, therefore, needs a relentless effort. In this paper, we study a comparative approach of three global PDF sets, viz. CT14, MMHT2014 and NNPDF 4.0. Gluon distribution functions and proton structure functions have been evaluated in a wide range of momentum fraction \textit{x} and energy scale \textit{Q}; and plausible observations have been made.</div>

While single-field models achieve phantom divide line (PDL) crossing and stable bounces, our $f(R,G,T)$-quintom coupling provides a novel implementation of a \textit{double} PDL crossing of $\omega_{\text{eff}}$ during the bounce. We address stability concerns through Hamiltonian analysis, showing that FLRW symmetry constraints suppress Ostrogradsky instabilities by reducing higher-derivative terms to metric invariant. The scalar field equation of motion is explicitly derived, confirming cancellation of pathological modes. Numerical reconstruction of five $f(R,G,T)$ models confirms non-singular bounces with $\rho_{\text{eff}}&gt;0$ and $c_s^2 \geq 0$, alongside parametric control over energy condition violations.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In many machine learning problems, understanding variable importance is a central concern. Two common approaches are Permute-and-Predict (PaP), which randomly permutes a feature in a validation set, and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO), which retrains models after permuting a training feature. Both methods deem a variable important if predictions with the original data substantially outperform those with permutations. In linear regression, empirical studies have linked PaP to regression coefficients and LOCO to $t$-statistics, but a formal theory has been lacking. We derive closed-form expressions for both measures, expressed using square-root transformations. PaP is shown to be proportional to the coefficient and predictor variability: $\text{PaP}_i = \beta_i \sqrt{2\operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{x}^v_i)}$, while LOCO is proportional to the coefficient but dampened by collinearity (captured by $\Delta$): $\text{LOCO}_i = \beta_i (1 -\Delta)\sqrt{1 + c}$. These derivations explain why PaP is largely unaffected by multicollinearity, whereas LOCO is highly sensitive to it. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings across varying levels of collinearity. Although derived for linear regression, we also show that these results provide reasonable approximations for models like Random Forests. Overall, this work establishes a theoretical basis for two widely used importance measures, helping analysts understand how they are affected by the true coefficients, dimension, and covariance structure. This work bridges empirical evidence and theory, enhancing the interpretability and application of variable importance measures.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We report on a novel set of very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (VHFQPO&#39;s) in the context of compact, non-singular horizonless objects. Focussing on the static, spherically symmetric case we utilize metrics of non-singular black holes that are accompanied by a regulator length scale $L &gt; 0$. The choice $L \gtrsim GM$ generically removes the horizon from these metrics leading to compact, horizonless but non-singular objects. This generically guarantees the existence of a stable orbit at small radii $r \ll r_\text{ISCO}$, independent of the angular momentum of the massive particle. Crucially, the absence of a horizon allows the resulting VHFQPO&#39;s to escape to infinity, spanning the range from 1kHz ($M = 10M_\odot$) to 25 kHz ($M = 2M_\odot$). Within the paradigm of non-singular spacetime geometries, the absence of such VHFQPO&#39;s from X-ray binary spectra implies the presence of a horizon around the central, compact object.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The horizon of a black hole, the &#34;surface of no return,&#34; is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon&#39;s properties, via a &#34;direct wave&#34; component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon&#39;s frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole&#39;s potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a sub-grid model for star formation in galaxy simulations, incorporating molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$) production via dust grain condensation and its destruction through star formation and photodissociation. Implemented within the magnetohydrodynamical code AREPO, our model tracks the non-equilibrium mass fractions of molecular, ionised, and atomic hydrogen, as well as a stellar component, by solving a system of differential equations governing mass exchange between these phases. Star formation is treated with a variable rate dependent on the local $\mathrm{H}_2$ abundance, which itself varies in a complex way with key quantities such as gas density and metallicity. Testing the model in a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, we obtain a well-defined spiral structure at $z = 0$, including a gas disc twice the size of the stellar one, alongside a realistic star formation history. Our results show a broad range of star formation efficiencies per free-fall time, from as low as $0.001\%$ at high redshift to values between $0.1\%$ and $10\%$ for ages $\gtrsim 3-4 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$. These findings align well with observational estimates and simulations of a turbulent interstellar medium. Notably, our model reproduces a star formation rate versus molecular hydrogen surface densities relation akin to the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Furthermore, we find that the star formation efficiency varies with density and metallicity, providing an alternative to fixed-efficiency assumptions and enabling comparisons with more detailed star formation models. Comparing different star formation prescriptions, we find that in models that link star formation to $\mathrm{H}_2$, star formation onset is $\sim \! 500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ later than those relying solely on total or cold gas density.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate FLRW cosmology in the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity with a nonminimal coupling between dark matter and the gravitational field. In the noncoincidence gauge, the field equations admit an equivalent multi-scalar field representation, which we investigate the phase-space using the Hubble-normalization approach. We classify all stationary points for arbitrary function $f(Q)$ and we discuss the physical properties of the asymptotic solutions. For the power-law theory, we perform a detailed stability analysis and show that the de Sitter solution is the unique future attractor, while the matter-dominated point appears as a saddle point. Moreover, there exist a family of scaling solutions that can be related to inflationary dynamics. In contrast with uncoupled $f(Q)$ models, the presence of the coupling introduces a viable matter-dominated era alongside late-time accelerated expansion. Our study shows that the coupling function plays a crucial role in cosmological dynamics in $f(Q)$ gravity.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed settings: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedmann equations and the holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario with the Hubble scale as infrared cutoff. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with standard $\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai-Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe&#39;s dynamics.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration. Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third, semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness, while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential for AI agent communication networks.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a detailed depolarization analysis of a radio galaxy ILTJ012215.21+254334.8, utilizing polarimetric data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue. The selected source exhibits a rotation measure (RM) of ~ - 47 rad/m^2 and a projected linear size of 335 kpc at a redshift z ~ 0.05. Depolarization model fitting was performed on LOFAR High Band Antenna data (120 - 168 MHz), with fractional polarization detected at 3.0%. Five depolarization models were tested, and Bayesian qu-fitting revealed that the three-component model (1T+2ED) best describes the data, with a reduced chi-squared value of 2.12 and a logarithmic Bayesian evidence of 1384.82. This model includes a Faraday-thin component at RM ~ - 0.3 rad/m^2 (instrumental leakage) and two external Faraday dispersion astrophysical emission at RM ~ - 47 rad/m^2. The results demonstrate that depolarization in low-frequency radio galaxies requires multi-component modelling and is driven by turbulence and inhomogeneity in the magneto-ionic medium. Our findings highlight the potential of LOFAR polarization studies for probing galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields with high precision.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The shape and orientation of the Milky Way&#39;s dark matter halo remain poorly constrained. Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial and tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it can be used to place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo that can support it close to steady state. We fit equilibrium orbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic Milky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo, assuming that the long axes of each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to parametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are consistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a short-to-long axis ratio of $q_\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis is inclined at an angle of $\beta_\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\,^\circ$ to the disc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\approx18^\circ$. Spherical haloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The best-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation; between radii of 6 and 60 kpc the tilt increases from $\beta_*(r)\approx10^\circ$ to $\approx35^\circ$. Our model provides a good fit to the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE. It is therefore an excellent source of realistic initial conditions for simulations of the halo, such as for investigating perturbations from satellites or the Galactic bar.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations, Woodcock-delta tracking is a common alternative to the more popular surface tracking technique. In this work we introduce a delta-tracking algorithm that tallies fluxes to a structured rectilinear mesh using the track-length estimator. This development also enables hybrid surface-delta tracking algorithms, because the track-length tally can be used everywhere for scalar flux estimation regardless of which tracking algorithm is employed. We use this tallying technique to develop a novel hybrid-in-energy method. We also implement a hybrid-in-material method, like what is implemented in Serpent2. We demonstrate that these delta tracking algorithms can be used in conjunction with continuously moving surfaces. We compare these methods showing figures of merit on four time-dependent problems (multi-group and continuous energy) solved with CPU- and GPU-based computers. Our implementation of delta tracking with a track length tally modestly improves figures of merit compared to standard delta tracking with a collision estimator and surface tracking with a track length estimator (1.5X 2.5X) for a problem with significant void regions. For both multi-group and continuous energy pressurized water reactor benchmarks, standard delta tracking with a collision estimator performs best. Hybrid-in-energy methods show significant improvements (7X-11X) for a continuous energy reactor benchmark problem.</div>

Located behind three massive lensing galaxy clusters Abell 1689, MACS J1149.5+2223, and MACS J0717.5+3745, galaxies in our sample have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.3$ and an intrinsic UV absolute magnitude range of $-20.9&lt;M_{UV}&lt;-13$. We measure nebular dust attenuation via Balmer optical depth ($\tau_{B}$) defined as the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio. We also derive physical properties from Hubble Space Telescope multi-wavelength photometry and construct composite spectra using median stacking in bins of $M_{*}$ and $\beta$. We find that the $\tau_{B}-\beta$ relation for the dwarf galaxies in this study is best represented by SMC dust curve. This is consistent with previous studies of low-metallicity galaxies at similar redshifts, which show a steep attenuation curve similar to the SMC curve, in contrast to high-metallicity and more massive galaxies that exhibit a much shallower dust attenuation curve. We also investigate the relationship between nebular dust attenuation and stellar mass, $E(B-V)_{nebular}-M_{*}$, down to $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim 7$. We demonstrate that this relation does not notably evolve with redshift and is consistent with what has been observed for local SDSS galaxies at similar low stellar masses.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Ultra-diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) are a subset of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs), showing mean effective surface brightness fainter than $24\ \rm mag\ \rm arcsec^{-2}$ and a diffuse morphology, with effective radii larger than 1.5 kpc. Due to their elusiveness, traditional methods are challenging to be used over large sky areas. Here we present a catalog of ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidates identified in the full 1350 deg$^2$ area of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) using deep learning. In particular, we use a previously developed network for the detection of low surface brightness systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[LSBGnet,][]{su2024lsbgnet} and optimised for UDG detection. We train this new UDG detection network for KiDS (UDGnet-K), with an iterative approach, starting from a small-scale training sample. After training and validation, the UGDnet-K has been able to identify $\sim3300$ UDG candidates, among which, after visual inspection, we have selected 545 high-quality ones. The catalog contains independent re-discovery of previously confirmed UDGs in local groups and clusters (e.g NGC 5846 and Fornax), and new discovered candidates in about 15 local systems, for a total of 67 {\it bona fide} associations. Besides the value of the catalog {\it per se} for future studies of UDG properties, this work shows the effectiveness of an iterative approach to training deep learning tools in presence of poor training samples, due to the paucity of confirmed UDG examples, which we expect to replicate for upcoming all-sky surveys like Rubin Observatory, Euclid and the China Space Station Telescope.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline&#39;s performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Weak gravitational lensing observations of galaxy clusters are sensitive to all mass along the line-of-sight, introducing systematic and additional statistical uncertainties due to intervening structures. We quantify their impact on the recovery of mass density profile parameters using 967 clusters from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation. We construct mock weak lensing maps, including both single source plane mocks and Euclid-like mocks with a realistic source redshift distribution. Applying Bayesian inference with Nautilus, we fit spherical and elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White models to recover the cluster mass, concentration, axis ratio, and centre, which we use to measure the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) offset from the potential centre, or `BCG wobble&#39;. We find that the spherical model fits clusters along under-dense sight-lines better than those along over-dense ones. This introduces a positive skew in the relative error distributions for mass and concentration, which increases with source redshift. In Euclid-like mocks, this results in a mean mass bias of $+5.3\pm1.4$% (significant at $3.5\sigma$) when assuming a spherical NFW model. We also detect a mean axis ratio bias of $-2.0\pm0.7$% ($2.9\sigma$), with no significant bias in concentration. We measure a BCG wobble of ~14 kpc in our Euclid-like mocks, with negligible contribution from line-of-sight structure. Furthermore, we predict the scatter in mass estimates from future weak lensing surveys that have mean source redshifts $z_\text s \gtrsim 1.2$ (such as the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope), will be dominated by line-of-sight structure and hence assuming a diagonal covariance matrix will lead to overestimating the precision. We conclude that cluster weak lensing pipelines should be calibrated on simulations with lightcone data in order to properly account for the significant impact of line-of-sight structure.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">These lecture notes delve into field-level inference, a framework offering a robust way to extract more information and avoid biases compared to traditional methods for cosmological data analysis. The core idea is to analyse uncompressed maps to infer underlying physical fields and cosmological parameters. We introduce Bayesian hierarchical field-level models and discuss sampling techniques for exploring complex, high-dimensional posterior distributions. We review the framework that underpins field-level inference. Finally, we highlight some state-of-the-art applications across various cosmological probes, and the growing role of machine learning in enhancing field-level inference capabilities.</div>

By training these flows on simulated data, we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios, including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data gaps.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The rapidly increasing sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is enabling the detection of a growing number of compact binary mergers. These events are crucial for understanding the population properties of compact binaries. However, many previous studies rely on computationally expensive inference frameworks, limiting their scalability. In this work, we present GWKokab, a JAX-based framework that enables modular model building with independent rate for each subpopulation such as BBH, BNS, and NSBH binaries. It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow based sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers. To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one comprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a multi-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at significantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity distribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also reproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric populations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also enable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin, eccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering deeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest at $z \sim 5$ offers a primary probe to constrain the history of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), retaining thermal and ionization signatures imprinted by the reionization process. In this work, we present a new inference framework based on JAX that combines forward-modeled Ly$\alpha$ forest observables with differentiable neural emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We construct a dataset of 501 low-resolution simulations generated with user-defined reionization histories and compute a set of 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectra and model-dependent covariance matrices. We then train two independent neural emulators that achieve sub-percent errors across relevant scales and combine them with HMC to efficiently perform parameter estimation. We validate this framework by applying it to a suite of mock observations, demonstrating that the true parameters are reliably recovered. While this work is limited by the low resolution of the simulations used, our results highlight the potential of this method for inferring the reionization history from high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Future improvements in our reionization models will further enhance its ability to extract constraints from observational datasets.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We introduce Nessie, a galaxy group finder implemented in Rust and distributed as both a Python and R package. Nessie employs the friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm and requires only on-sky position and redshift as input, making it immediately applicable to surveys that lack a well-defined luminosity function. We implement several algorithmic optimizations including binary search and k-d tree pre-selection that significantly improve performance by reducing unnecessary galaxy pair checks. To validate the accuracy of Nessie, we tune its parameters using a suite of GALFORM mock lightcones and achieve a strong Figure of Merit. We further demonstrate its reliability by applying it to both the GAMA and SDSS surveys, where it produces group catalogues consistent with those in the literature. Additional functionality is included for comparison with simulations and mock catalogues. Benchmarking on a standard MacBook Pro (M3 chip with 11 cores) shows that version 1 of Nessie can process about 1 million galaxies in around 10 seconds, highlighting its speed and suitability for next-generation redshift surveys.</div>

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The 21 cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionisation is widely modelled using semi-numeric simulations, used for their computational speed and flexibility in testing astrophysical and cosmological parameters. However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k&gt;1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The demand for long and accurate gravitational waveforms is increasing as we prepare for the next generation of detectors and seek to improve current waveform models. However, numerical relativity waveforms, while highly accurate, are often too short for these applications due to their high computational cost. Hybrid waveforms, which stitch together gravitational wave signals from different modeling approaches, provide a way to generate complete inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. While hybridization is well-established for aligned-spin systems, precession introduces additional complexities due to gauge ambiguities, frame dependence, or spin dynamics. Here we study the challenges associated with alignment of precessing waveforms and present a systematic approach for constructing hybrid waveforms of precessing quasi-circular systems. Our approach relies on minimal assumptions about the merger waveforms and employs the quadrupole-aligned frame to mitigate mode-mixing. Our method is designed to be robust and broadly applicable, imposing minimal constraints on the input waveforms. This framework expands the applicability of hybridization techniques, facilitating flexible hybrid construction for parameter estimation, model calibration, and gravitational-wave data analysis.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The architecture of planetary systems is a key piece of information to our understanding of their formation and evolution. This information also allows us to place the Solar System in the exoplanet context. An important example is the impact of outer giant planets on the formation of inner super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. Radial velocity (RV) surveys aim at drawing statistical insights into the (anti-)correlations between giants and inner small planets, which remain unclear. These surveys are limited by the completeness of the systems, namely, the sensitivity of the data to planet detections. Here, we show that we can improve the completeness by accounting for orbital stability. We introduce the Algorithm for the Refinement of DEtection limits via N-body stability Threshold (ARDENT), an open-source Python package for detection limits that include the stability constraint. The code computes the classic data-driven detection limits, along with the dynamical limits via both analytical and numerical stability criteria. We present the code strategy and illustrate its performance on TOI-1736 using published SOPHIE RVs. This system contains an eccentric cold giant on a 570-day orbit and an inner sub-Neptune on a 7-day orbit. We demonstrate that no additional planet can exist in this system beyond 150 days due to the gravitational influence of the giant. This outcome allows us to significantly refine the system completeness and also carries implications for RV follow-ups. ARDENT is user-friendly and can be employed across a wide variety of systems to refine our understanding of their architecture.</div>

It can describe the known models such as Quintessence, k-essence, DGP, $f(R)$, and Horndeski theories. In this work, we update constraints on EFTofDE by utilizing the most up-to-date public data including the BAO (DESI DR2), CMB (Planck 2018 \&amp; ACT DR6), SNIa (DESY5), weak lensing (DESY3) and full-shape galaxy power (BOSS DR12). We find with the $\Lambda$CDM background, general relativity (GR) is favored by the data, while with the $w0wa$CDM background, slight modification to GR is favored, but still consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$. We also find the significance level for dynamical DE is greatly reduced within EFTofDE compared to within GR, indicating the degeneracy between dynamical DE and MG.</div>

However, their existence requires the violation of the null energy condition, making their detection a bit challenging. The essay aims at showing the new avenues probing the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes and grey body factors, the two fundamental aspects in wave dynamics. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the grey body factors in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers has been investigated. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravity wave observations. Advances in high-precision interferometry and multi-messenger astronomy may soon offer crucial insights into the existence of these exotic structures.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">As old stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) are key fossil tracers of galaxy formation and interaction histories. This paper is part of the LEWIS project, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band imaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf galaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed MUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively bright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify additional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC candidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and morphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to constrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the spectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four in UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify four intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact dwarf with a radial velocity only $\Delta v = -85 \pm 10\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ relative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness corrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we estimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\sim40$ for the investigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four UDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an intermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new Mathematica package that provides a platform to perform multi-loop computations. ANATAR integrates several existing tools designed for higher-order computations. In particular, it uses QGRAF to generate Feynman diagrams and relies on FORM to perform the Dirac and colour algebras. This makes it very efficient without compromising user-friendliness and flexibility. In addition, ANATAR is equipped with functionalities to manipulate the generated amplitudes and to extract scalar form factors. The resulting expressions can be mapped to integral families that can subsequently be reduced to master integrals via dedicated interfaces to codes for integration-by-parts reduction. Support for large classes of BSM models with the same gauge group as the SM is provided, and in particular, ANATAR is optimised for computations in effective field theories. We review and introduce the main functionalities of ANATAR and illustrate its use for phenomenological applications.</div>

The parameters of the model has been constrained using Cosmic Chronometers (CC) in combination with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon$^+$ Type Ia supernova datasets. We have observed that the deceleration parameter shows a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase and the effective equation of state parameter ($\omega$) approaches to $-1$ at late times. The $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a decreasing profile, confirming quintessence-like behavior, and the statefinder analysis demonstrates trajectories that remain near the $\Lambda$CDM fixed point but deviate into the quintessence region. The evolution of the density parameters satisfies the flatness condition, and the predicted age of the Universe lies within $t_0 \sim 13.7-14.3$ Gyr, consistent with CMB and stellar estimates. The findings indicate that the logarithmic model successfully reproduces the late-time accelerated expansion for both the choices of the matter Lagrangian.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys conducted over the last couple of decades have proven crucial in deepening our understanding of structure growth in the Universe and galaxy evolution. While there have been several such surveys, until now those that achieve the high completeness and precision necessary to probe the low-mass end of galaxy groups have been limited to relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.3$), with surveys exploring the more distant Universe being constrained by small sample sizes and/or low redshift completeness. The recent Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) aims to explore galaxy environment over the last $\sim6$ Gyr with a completeness level comparable to the most complete local Universe surveys ($&gt;85\%$). In this work, we present the galaxy group catalogue for the D10-COSMOS field from DEVILS, which achieves a redshift completeness of $90\%$ for galaxies with $Y&lt;21.2$ mag. We showcase the science potential by exploring the impact of environment on the fraction and power of active galactic nuclei (AGN), finding that satellites in galaxy groups show no evidence of altered AGN properties, while satellites in clusters exhibit increased AGN fractions but decreased AGN luminosities.</div>

(gemini fallback)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1&#34;~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances &lt;100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present a new class of KERR-SEN solutions that respect SO(2) symmetry, constructed systematically using the Laurent series expansion method. This approach is based on stationary, axisymmetric Euclidean solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations and incorporates advanced techniques for generating stationary gravitational fields, including the variation-of-constants method and nonlinear superposition. Through this unified framework, we obtain fresh insights into axially symmetric gravitational systems, extend the traditional hierarchy of Kerr-NUT solutions, and bring together several foundational analytic methods under a common structure. The paper offers explicit derivations, supported by numerical simulations, and provides a detailed discussion of the physical consequences, particularly focusing on the roles of dilaton and axion fields. The extended version also includes a comprehensive historical overview of axisymmetric exact solutions, a thorough explanation of the Laurent series formalism in gravitational theory, and an in-depth analysis of the theoretical and astrophysical significance of KERR-SEN metrics in current research.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Stellar surface abundances are records of the state of the gas from which stars formed, and thus trace how individual elements have mixed into the surrounding medium following their ejection from stars. In this work, we test the common assumption of instantaneous and homogeneous metal mixing during the formation of the first Population II stars by characterizing the chemical homogeneity of the gas in simulated star-forming environments enriched by Population III stellar feedback. Testing the homogeneity of metal mixing in this time period is necessary for understanding the spread of abundances in the most metal-poor stars, and the (in)homogeneity of individual sites of star formation. Using Aeos, a suite of star-by-star cosmological simulations, we quantify how gas abundances change over space and time relative to Population II stellar abundances using Mahalanobis distances, a measure of covariance-normalized dissimilarity. We find that the homogeneous mixing assumption holds only within $\sim100$ pc of a star-forming region and $\sim 7$ Myr following the star formation event. Beyond this regime, deviations between stellar and gas abundances increase until they become indistinguishable from assuming a homogeneous mix of metals averaged over the initial mass function. This highlights the limited applicability of assuming instantaneous and homogeneous mixing in realistic halo environments at high redshift. We identify critical mixing scales that are necessary to explore chemical evolution in the early Universe. These scales can be applied to determine the precision needed for accurate chemical tagging of observed data and to explore parameter space with analytical models.</div>

(gemini)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Predicting the statistical properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) density field during reionization is an important step in using upcoming 21 cm observations to constrain models of reionization. Semi-numerical models of reionization are often coupled with the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which determines the fraction of dark matter within halos. In this work, we improve upon earlier prescriptions that compute $f_{\text{coll}}$ based on the dark matter overdensity $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ alone, to include more information about the environment in the form of eigenvalues of the tidal tensor. We compute the mean of the $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on these eigenvalues from a set of high-resolution, small-volume simulations and use them to sample the $f_{\text{coll}}$ field of a low-resolution, large-volume simulation. We subsequently use a semi-numerical code for reionization to compute the HI density field and its power spectrum, and benchmark our results against a reference high-resolution, large-volume simulation. Across variations in redshift, ionized fraction, grid resolution, and minimum halo mass, our method recovers the large-scale HI power spectrum with errors at the $\lesssim 2\%-5\%$ level for $k \lesssim 0.5~ h~ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, providing a substantial improvement over the $\sim 10\%$ results previously obtained using density-only conditioning. Overall, this makes our method a simple yet efficient tool for forward modeling HI maps during reionization.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We use the TNG50 simulation to explore the possible existence of satellite galaxy sets, with fixed-in-time identities, forming kinematically-persistent planes (KPPs) along cosmic time around 190 MW/M31-like galaxies. This is the first study to assess their frequency within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We identify KPPs around 46 of these host galaxies, with at least 25\% of their satellites in such configurations. Thereby, KPPs appear more frequent than previously reported, appearing in $\sim24\%$ of MW/M31-like systems, and in $\sim40\%$ of those populated with $N_{\rm sat}\geq9$. We find a dependency of the former frequency on the minimum satellite stellar mass cut, suggesting that it would increase with higher mass resolution. KPP satellite members form a distinct set compared to satellites outside KPPs, located at further distances from the center of their host and maintaining higher specific angular momentum since high redshift. KPP satellites form thin and oblate planes in positional space during long periods of cosmic time. We statistically confirm that KPPs form a kind of backbone of observationally-detected positional planes, and that, in velocity space, KPPs behave as kinematic morphological disks. We show that KPP formation, defined as the time when satellite orbital poles align around a specific, fixed direction (occurring at Universe age $\sim4$ Gyr), predates the end of halo&#39;s fast-phase of mass assembly, indicating that halo processes do not drive this clustering. Finally, our results are broadly consistent with the MW&#39;s kinematic plane at $z=0$ concerning its morphological properties and degree of satellite orbital poles clustering, mitigating the tension between the existence of these structures and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate&#39;s gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO&#39;s potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Recent investigations of vacuum polarization in extremely compact stars suggest that, in such regimes, the effective matter content of spacetime may acquire a vacuum-energy equation of state with negative energy density, mimicking a negative cosmological constant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a general algorithm to modify well-known spherically symmetric regular black hole metrics by replacing their usual de Sitter cores (dSC) with Anti-de Sitter cores (AdSC). Like their dSC counterparts, these AdSC solutions may exhibit two, one, or no horizons depending on the value of a regularization parameter l. We present explicit examples of AdSC-Bardeen and AdSC-Dymnikova metrics, analyze their main properties, and investigate some of their phenomenological signatures using test fields. In particular, we compare their fundamental quasinormal modes and echo signals with those of the dSC cases, highlighting potential avenues for distinguishing them observationally.</div>

The Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter submillimeter telescope (XSMT-15m), to be constructed at a premier high-altitude site (4813 m) in Qinghai, China, marks a major milestone for Chinese astronomy, establishing the China mainland&#39;s first independently developed, world-class submillimeter facility. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, XSMT-15m will address a diverse range of frontier scientific questions spanning extragalactic astronomy, Galactic structure, time-domain astrophysics, and astrochemistry. In synergy with current and forthcoming observatories, XSMT-15m will illuminate the formation and evolution of galaxies, unravel the physical and chemical processes shaping the interstellar medium, and explore transient phenomena in the submillimeter regime. These capabilities will advance our understanding across extragalactic astronomy, Galactic ecology, astrochemistry, and time-domain astrophysics, inaugurating a new era for submillimeter research in China and the northern hemisphere.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We constrain the parameter space of Bumblebee model within a cosmological background and investigate the properties of gravitational waves under the constrained parameter set. Specifically, we derive the conditions for the absence of ghost, Laplacian, and Tachyon instabilities for perturbations in a cosmological background. By incorporating the observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the observational constraints on tensor gravitational waves, we derive bounds on the parameter space of Bumblebee model. We then examine the polarization modes, propagation speeds, and amplitude relations of gravitational waves within this constrained framework. Our results indicate that the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$ must be non-positive, and the lower bound on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\xi b^2$ is constrained to be on the order of $10^{-15}$. Gravitational waves in Bumblebee model are found to propagate in two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one mixed scalar mode. Notably, the tensor gravitational waves travel at subluminal speeds, whereas the vector and scalar gravitational waves propagate at superluminal speeds. These results provide a concrete theoretical framework and specific observational signatures for testing Lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector with future gravitational-wave detectors.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We determine the internal energy of charged particle production in minimum bias pp collisions using a thermostatistical approach by analyzing the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum reported by the ALICE Collaboration across LHC energies. To do this, we define temperature as the slope of the $p_\text{T}$ spectrum at low $p_\text{T}$ values and Shannon&#39;s entropy as the system&#39;s entropy, calculated considering the normalized $p_\text{T}$ spectrum. We found that the internal energy for the Hagedorn and Tricomi functions behaves linearly with temperature at low temperatures but becomes nonlinear at LHC energies, showing a thermal-nonthermal transition in the production of charged particles in pp collisions. Our estimation of the transition center of mass energy is $\sqrt{s^*}=27(11)\text{ keV}$ at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=0$, which explains why the production of high $p_\text{T}$ hadrons has always been observed, even in earlier experiments, which may also encompass other experiments colliding e$^-$p or e$^+$e$^-$.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The source of high redshift dust has long been debated. One possible source are the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is uncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock and be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of the pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of dust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional soft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of temperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust aggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there are many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate. Thus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare the aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics themselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more compact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that structures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and more compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar conditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics except for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the least reliable of the four considered metrics.</div>

We obtain exact solutions of particular interest, including de Sitter, scaling, $\Lambda$CDM, Chaplygin gas, generalized Chaplygin gas, and CPL parameterizations. The corresponding scalar potentials and $f(Q)$ functions are derived in closed or parametric form. Our analysis shows that non-coincident $f(Q)$ gravity admits a richer solution space than the coincident case and can describe both early-time inflationary dynamics and late-time acceleration within a unified framework.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">What does third family ($t$-$b$-$\tau$) Yukawa unification, a typical prediction from embedding the Standard Model (SM) fermions in 16-plets of a $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ GUT, imply for the scale of the supersymmetric (SUSY) partners? Which neutralino dark matter (DM) candidate can be realized, and how large is the DM relic density? In this work, we address these questions in a simplified SUSY-breaking framework: the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). To this end, we recast the parameter space of the CMSSM in a way that for all parameter points the SM-like Higgs mass is correctly reproduced. Considering fixed $\tan\beta$ and $\mathrm{sgn}(\mu)$, for every point in the $(x:=\frac{M_{1/2}}{m_0},y:=\frac{A_0}{m_0})$ parameter plane ranges for all observables are predicted. This provides a new perspective on where in parameter space different types of DM are realized, and which value of the SUSY scale is required in order to explain the observed mass of the SM Higgs boson. In our analysis we consider and compare two strategies: grid scans over the $(x,y,\tan\beta)$ parameter region and MCMC sampling. We find both techniques yield similar results. For $t$-$b$-$\tau$ unification within $5\,\%$ or $10\,\%$, we find $\mu&lt;0$, the SUSY spectrum showing a characteristic pattern, and the SUSY scale around $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The extra MSSM Higgses are the lowest lying new states at $\sim 2\div 3\,\mathrm{TeV}$ (with discovery potential at the HL-LHC), the $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ stops and gluino are in reach of a possible FCC-hh, while bino DM has a mass above $2.5\,\mathrm{TeV}$, is overabundant, and effectively unobservable in planned direct and indirect detection experiments. The DM relic density requires a dilution factor of $10&lt;\mathcal{D}&lt;1000$, implying non-standard cosmology that could leave its imprints in the stochastic gravitational wave background.</div>

The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.</div>

These tests are inspired by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and its nonparametric counterparts. They allow for testing linear relationships in factorial designs between discrete probability measures and are based on pairwise comparisons of the OT distance and corresponding barycenters. To this end, we derive under the null hypotheses and (local) alternatives the asymptotic distribution of empirical OT costs and the empirical OT barycenter cost functional as the optimal value of linear programs with random objective function. In particular, we extend existing techniques for probability to signed measures and show directional Hadamard differentiability and the validity of the functional delta method. We discuss computational issues, permutation and bootstrap tests, and back up our findings with simulations. We illustrate our methodology on two datasets from cellular biophysics and biometric identification.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don&#39;t know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.</div>

(gemini fallback)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">In the hierarchical assembly framework, the accretion history of the Milky Way is crucial to understand its evolution. However, in massive mergers, integrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars across dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$). Additionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring halo-like orbits. Consequently, even for minor mergers, which should preserve dynamical coherence, we expect their kinematic-defined samples to be contaminated by both the massive merger(s) and the disc stars. This study aims at quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they are defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only chemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo substructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian Mixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a star-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Al, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a shared origin with GSE. Heracles, Thamnos and the Helmi Stream all likely comprise GSE and heated disc stars in a significant amount. Besides these two populations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties compatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\omega$ Cen in Thamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius. Halo stars chemically compatible with GSE are spread throughout the $E-L_z$ space and considerably contaminate every halo substructure studied in this work. None of these substructures appears to be a unique population of stars with its own origin. In addition to GSE, they all appear to be mixtures of stars chemically compatible either with the metal-poor disc, Sagittarius, $\omega$ Cen, or with a combination of them.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Hadronization, a non-perturbative process, cannot be calculated from first principles. It can be investigated either by phenomenological models or by examining the behavior of produced hadrons or through fragmentation functions. These fragmentation functions are non-perturbative quantities whose determination relies entirely on experimental data. However, higher-twist fragmentation functions present significant challenges for their determination due to power suppression. In this paper, we propose an asymmetry to study twist-3 fragmentation functions. This asymmetry is defined as the transverse momentum asymmetry of the fragmenting quark and/or the produced jet with respect to the observed hadron direction within the semi-inclusive electron positron annihilation process. As a twist-3 effect, this asymmetry is sensitive to the distribution of the jet relative to the produced hadron direction during hadronization. Furthermore, it is closely related to twist-3 transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions and provides a set of measurable quantities for their determination.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We construct an analytic f(R) gravity model that unifies early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration within a single covariant framework. At high curvature, the model reproduces a Starobinsky-like inflationary plateau, while at low curvature it asymptotes to a stable dark energy-dominated phase. In the scalar-tensor representation, this construction yields a hilltop-type potential in the Jordan frame, which maps to an exponential potential in the Einstein frame. To account for radiative effects, we introduce a logarithmic correction to the Einstein-frame potential inspired by one-loop effective field theory, producing a late-time flattening without requiring fine-tuning. The resulting scalaron dynamics reduce the effective mass to O(H_0), inducing a thawing regime that deviates from a cosmological constant at the sub-percent levels. A joint background likelihood analysis using Pantheon+SH0ES and BAO+CC datasets (within the CPL parametrization) yields H_0 = 73.4+-0.6 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m = 0.253+-0.007, consistent with local expansion rate measurements. The best-fit scalar field parameters are phi_0 \approx 0.027\,M_Pl and lambda \approx 0.010\,M_Pl, corresponding to a present-day dark energy equation of state w_0 \approx -0.985. While compatible with LambdaCDM within current observational bounds, the model satisfies GR recovery at low curvature and exhibits attractor-like behavior, thereby minimizing sensitivity to initial conditions.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Large language models (LLMs) can internally distinguish between evaluation and deployment contexts, a behaviour known as \emph{evaluation awareness}. This undermines AI safety evaluations, as models may conceal dangerous capabilities during testing. Prior work demonstrated this in a single $70$B model, but the scaling relationship across model sizes remains unknown. We investigate evaluation awareness across $15$ models scaling from $0.27$B to $70$B parameters from four families using linear probing on steering vector activations. Our results reveal a clear power-law scaling: evaluation awareness increases predictably with model size. This scaling law enables forecasting deceptive behavior in future larger models and guides the design of scale-aware evaluation strategies for AI safety.

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This study addresses the unresolved problem of selecting the regularization parameter in the fused lasso. In particular, we extend the framework of the Spacing Test proposed by Tibshirani et al. to the fused lasso, providing a theoretical foundation for post-selection inference by characterizing the selection event as a polyhedral constraint. Based on the analysis of the solution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact conditional $p$-values for the selected change-points. Our method broadens the applicability of the Spacing Test from the standard lasso to fused penalty structures. Furthermore, through numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with sequential versions of AIC and BIC as well as cross-validation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach properly controls the type I error while achieving high detection power. This work offers a theoretically sound and computationally practical solution for parameter selection and post-selection inference in structured signal estimation problems.

At J-PARC, we show that the magnetized gaseous argon detectors of ND280 could place leading limits on light particles decaying to $e^+e^-$ and that the liquid-scintillator detectors of the J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at the JSNS (JSNS$^2$) experiment can exploit double- and triple-coincidence signals from $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^-$ to place new limits on particles produced in kaon decay. We find that the Coherent Captain Mills detector at Los Alamos and the suite of COHERENT detectors at Oak Ridge, despite their smaller size, would also have a promising sensitivity to particles produced in pion and muon decays, depending on background levels.

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">This paper establishes a fundamental isomorphism between the abstract framework of $G$-expectation and a concrete parameterized family of classical stochastic processes, providing a unified framework for nonlinear stochastic calculus under model uncertainty. We demonstrate that $G$-Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be intrinsically represented as controlled processes $\{B_t^\theta\}_{\theta \in \mathcal{A}^\Theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes an admissible control process taking values in a compact convex parameter set $\Theta$ encoding volatility uncertainty. The core contribution is the construction of a complete algebraic and analytic isomorphism $\Phi$ that preserves all operations including addition, multiplication, function composition, and limit transitions. This isomorphism provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding $G$-martingales, with a distinction between symmetric martingales (fair in all volatility scenarios) and asymmetric martingales (favorable but fair only in the worst-case scenario). We develop a comprehensive theory for solving $G$-SDEs through their parameterized representations, establishing existence and uniqueness results under standard Lipschitz and growth conditions. The framework reveals how bounded control sets preserve these classical conditions while capturing volatility uncertainty. The parameterized control perspective offers both mathematical rigor and computational practicality, enabling the transfer of classical stochastic calculus results to the $G$-expectation framework while maintaining the essential sublinear structure of model uncertainty.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than 80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.</div>

                <div class="arxiv-abstract-text">Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks, fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.</div>

Building on the concept of (weak) Fr\&#39;echet conditional means, we develop an additive regression model that represents the metric-based discrepancy of the response as a sum of covariate-specific nonlinear functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). To address the absence of linear structure in the response space, we transform the response via squared distances, enabling an interpretable and tractable additive decomposition. Variable selection is performed using Elastic Net regularization, extended to the RKHS setting, and further refined through a local linear approximation scheme that incorporates folded concave penalties such as the SCAD. We establish theoretical guarantees, including variable selection consistency and the strong oracle property, under minimal assumptions tailored to metric-space-valued responses. Simulations and applications to distributional and matrix-valued data demonstrate the scalability, interpretability, and practical effectiveness of the proposed approach. This work provides a principled foundation for statistical learning with random object data.</div>
